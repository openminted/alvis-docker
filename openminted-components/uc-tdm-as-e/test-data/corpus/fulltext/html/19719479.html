          <p>The WRINKLED1 (WRI1) protein is an important regulator of oil accumulation in maturing Arabidopsis seeds. WRI1 is a member of a plant-specific family of transcription factors (AP2/EREBP) that share either one or two copies of a DNA-binding domain called the AP2 domain. Here, it is shown that WRI1 acts as a transcriptional enhancer of genes involved in carbon metabolism in transgenic seeds overexpressing this transcription factor. <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em>, two genes encoding enzymes of the glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, respectively, have been chosen to investigate the regulatory action exerted by WRI1 over these pathways. Using the reporter gene <em>uidA</em>, it was possible to demonstrate <em>in planta</em> that WRI1 regulates the activity of both <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoters. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments showed that WRI1 was able to interact with the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter. To further elucidate the regulatory mechanism controlling the transcription of these genes, functional dissections of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoters were performed. Two enhancers, of 54 and 79 bp, respectively, have thus been isolated that are essential to direct the activity of these promoters in oil-accumulating tissues of the embryo. A consensus site is present in these enhancers as well as in other putative target promoters of WRI1. Loss of this consensus sequence in the <em>BCPP2</em> promoter decreases both the strength of the interaction between WRI1 and this promoter in yeast and the activity of the promoter <em>in planta</em>.</p>

          <p>After the biochemical pathways producing storage lipids in oilseed species like <em>Brassica napus</em> or <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> were largely described (<a href="#b54" rel="references:#b54" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Voelker and Kinney, 2001</a>), the elucidation of the regulation of oil synthesis has become a major challenge (<a href="#b40" rel="references:#b40" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ohlrogge and Jaworski, 1997</a>). Complementary studies carried out on developing seeds and/or embryos have established that the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and lipids are largely regulated at the level of transcription (<a href="#b18" rel="references:#b18" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Fawcett <em>et al.</em>, 1994</a>; <a href="#b39" rel="references:#b39" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">O’Hara <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>; <a href="#b5" rel="references:#b5" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud and Graham, 2006</a>). In <em>A. thaliana</em>, microarray analyses have been used to characterize the ‘contrapuntal’ or differential timing of the expression of genes involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis and lipid metabolism during seed maturation (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). Genes related to the biosynthesis and storage of triacylglycerols (TAGs) show several distinct temporal expression patterns. For instance, a number of genes encoding fatty acid synthesis enzymes display a bell-shaped pattern of expression at the onset of the maturation phase, whereas the expression of fatty-acid modifying enzymes and oleosins increases later (<a href="#b7" rel="references:#b7" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud and Lepiniec, 2009</a>). The observation that the mRNAs of several genes encoding enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway accumulate in a coordinated manner strongly suggests that those members of the pathway are co-regulated, and presumably share common <em>cis</em>- and <em>trans</em>-regulatory elements. This hypothesis has been strengthened by the isolation and characterization of the WRINKLED1 (WRI1) transcription factor (<a href="#b20" rel="references:#b20" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Focks and Benning, 1998</a>; <a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>; <a href="#b34" rel="references:#b34" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Masaki <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>). WRI1 is a direct target of LEAFY COTYLEDON2 (LEC2) that specifies the regulatory action of this master regulator of seed maturation towards fatty acid metabolism (<a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>). Putative targets of WRI1 encode enzymes of late glycolysis, the fatty acid synthesis pathway, and the biotin and lipoic acid biosynthetic pathways (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>; <a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>).</p>

          <p>WRI1 is a member of the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element binding (AP2/EREBP) proteins, one of the largest transcription factor families in <em>A. thaliana</em> (<a href="#b44" rel="references:#b44" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Riechmann <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>). This family is best characterized by a common AP2 domain of about 60 amino acids that is important for DNA binding (<a href="#b27" rel="references:#b27" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Jofuku <em>et al.</em>, 1994</a>; <a href="#b42" rel="references:#b42" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Okamuro <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>; <a href="#b43" rel="references:#b43" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Riechmann and Meyerowitz, 1998</a>; <a href="#b46" rel="references:#b46" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Sakuma <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). While the AP2/EREBP transcription factor family is unique to plants, proteins containing homologues of the AP2 domain have been identified in cyanobacteria, ciliates and viruses, where they are predicted to function as mobile endonucleases (<a href="#b33" rel="references:#b33" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Magnani <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>; <a href="#b55" rel="references:#b55" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Wessler, 2005</a>; <a href="#b49" rel="references:#b49" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Shigyo <em>et al.</em>, 2006</a>). Based on the presence of the conserved AP2-like domains, 147 proteins were identified as belonging to the AP2/EREBP family in <em>A. thaliana</em> (<a href="#b19" rel="references:#b19" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Feng <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>). The AP2/EREBP family members are classified in groups based on the number of AP2 domains and the presence of other domains. The EREBP family (122 members), which has a single AP2 domain, is composed of two subgroups, namely the ERF (65 members) and DREB subfamilies (57 members). Proteins of the RAV family (six members) contain one AP2 domain and a second DNA binding domain (the B3-like domain). The AP2 family (19 members), which has two AP2 domains, is further divided into two monophyletic groups, the APETALA2-like and AINTEGUMENTA (ANT)-like groups. Depending on the publications, the WRI1-like group, composed of WRI1, At2g41710, At1g16060 and At1g79700, is either presented as a third monophyletic group of the AP2 family (<a href="#b38" rel="references:#b38" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Nole-Wilson <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>) or as a part of the ANT-like group (<a href="#b49" rel="references:#b49" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Shigyo <em>et al.</em>, 2006</a>).</p>

          <p>DNA binding specificity has been studied for proteins that contain a single AP2 repeat. Proteins of the ERF subfamily bind to ethylene response elements (ERE) or GCC boxes. These boxes consist of 11-bp sequences (TAAGAGGCCGCC) exhibiting a GCCGCC core required for protein binding (<a href="#b41" rel="references:#b41" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ohme-Takagi and Shinshi, 1995</a>; <a href="#b21" rel="references:#b21" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Fujimoto <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>; <a href="#b50" rel="references:#b50" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Song <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>). The solution structure of the AP2 domain of AtERF1 bound to the GCC box has been determined (<a href="#b3" rel="references:#b3" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Allen <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>). Proteins of the DREB subfamily bind to dehydration response elements (DREs)/C-repeats containing the core sequence CCGAC (<a href="#b4" rel="references:#b4" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baker <em>et al.</em>, 1994</a>). The single AP2 repeat of the RAV1 transcription factor has been shown to bind to a CAACA motif, whereas the B3 domain binds to a CACCTG sequence (<a href="#b28" rel="references:#b28" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Kagaya <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>). Little is known about the interactions between members of the AP2 family of proteins and DNA. A consensus binding sequence of the AINTEGUMENTA (ANT) protein determined <em>in vitro</em> is 5′-gCAC(A/G)N(A/T)TcCC(a/g)ANG(c/t)-3′ (<a href="#b37" rel="references:#b37" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000</a>). This consensus is much longer than sites recognized by proteins containing a single AP2 repeat. Each AP2 repeat of ANT contacts juxtaposed subsites within the consensus sequence, demonstrating that ANT utilizes a mode of DNA recognition distinct from that used by proteins containing a single AP2 domain (<a href="#b29" rel="references:#b29" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Krizek, 2003</a>). To date, given the lack of information about the binding properties of proteins of the AP2-like and WRI1-like groups, it has not been possible to determine whether all of the transcription factors of the AP2 family share a similar mode of DNA recognition.</p>

          <p>In this paper, it is shown that WRI1 can be used in a seed-specific manner to enhance the transcription level of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes in tissues where these genes are already expressed. Consistent with this, it is demonstrated that WRI1 is able to regulate <em>in planta</em> the activity of the <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> promoters. In addition, electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and yeast one-hybrid experiments show that WRI1 is able to interact with the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter. These results strongly suggest that WRI1, which is a limiting factor of lipogenic gene expression in seeds, directly induces the transcriptional activation of these genes at the onset of the maturation phase. Functional dissections of the <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoters allow isolating putative binding sites to be present in several target promoters of WRI1. Finally, the modification of the consensus sequence thus isolated modulates the strength of the interaction between WRI1 and the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter, both <em>in vitro</em> and in yeast, as well as the activity of the promoter <em>in planta</em>. Taken together, these results provide original insights into our understanding of the transcriptional activation of the glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways in <em>A. thaliana</em>, and they pave the way for further analyses aimed at elucidating the regulatory network controlling oil accumulation in seeds.</p>

          <h4>Seed-specific overexpression of <em>WRI1</em> enhances the mRNA accumulation of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>Transcriptomic analyses (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>) and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR experiments (<a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>) have previously been carried out on plant material exhibiting altered <em>WRI1</em> mRNA levels, e.g. <em>wri1</em> seeds or rosette leaves overexpressing <em>WRI1</em>. These approaches have led to the identification of putative target genes of WRI1 that encode enzymes of late glycolysis and the <em>de novo</em> fatty acid biosynthetic network in plastids. WRI1 has consequently been presented as a potential activator of these pathways in plants that could be exploited in biotechnological approaches designed to stimulate oil accumulation in seeds (<a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>). The ability of WRI1 to enhance the mRNA accumulation of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes has been clearly established in seedlings (<a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>) and rosette leaves (<a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>), where these genes are normally expressed at low/basal levels. It was then essential to check whether <em>WRI1</em> overexpression could increase the mRNA accumulation of these genes in maturing seeds, where they are already expressed at high levels. Unfortunately, <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> lines (<a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>) could not be exploited for such a purpose. These transgenic lines exhibited a stunted, bushy phenotype, and were partially sterile. Fine physiological analyses of maturing seeds could not be carried with the very poor seed set present in developing siliques (<a href="#t1" rel="references:#t1" class="tableLink" title="Link to table" shape="rect">Table 1</a>). Alternatively, <em>WRI1</em> cDNA was placed under the control of the strong and seed-specific oleosin <em>S2</em>/<em>OLEO4</em> (<em>At3g27670</em>) promoter (<a href="#b48" rel="references:#b48" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Schmid <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>). First, a <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:uidA</em> transgene was constructed that allowed the pattern of activity of the <em>S2</em> promoter to be verified: <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub> activity was only detected in the embryonic tissues of maturing seeds (M. Miquel and N. Reinhard Dichow, unpublished data). A <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> transgene was then constructed and tested for its ability to complement the strong <em>wri1-1</em> mutation (<a href="#b20" rel="references:#b20" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Focks and Benning, 1998</a>; <a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>). Five independent <em>wri1-1</em> plants carrying this construct were selected, and their progeny were subjected to fatty acid analyses (<a href="#f1" rel="references:#f1" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 1</a>). If fully complemented, segregating seeds of F<sub>1</sub> progeny are expected to exhibit at least a 75% reversion of the mutant phenotype (one insertion locus). A significant restoration of both fatty acid concentration (<a href="#f1" rel="references:#f1" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 1</a>) and fatty acid composition (data not shown) was measured in all five lines, demonstrating that a functional WRI1 protein was synthesized. Transgenic plants carrying the <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> construct in a Wassilewskija (Ws) wild-type background were then generated to avoid any indirect affect of the <em>wri1-1</em> mutation on plant growth. Four primary transformants with a single insertion locus (see <a href="#ss14" rel="references:#ss14" class="sectionLink" title="Link to section" shape="rect">Experimental procedures</a>) were characterized. Neither vegetative growth nor fertility was affected in these lines. Using a quantitative RT-PCR strategy, <em>WRI1</em> mRNA level was quantified in maturing siliques of these lines (<a href="#f2" rel="references:#f2" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 2</a>). Expression levels ranging from 370 to 1040% of the <em>EF1αA4</em> (<em>At5g60390</em>) mRNA level (constitutive expression; <a href="#b36" rel="references:#b36" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Nesi <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>) were detected 16 days after anthesis (DAA), indicating that <em>WRI1</em> was efficiently overexpressed in these lines (from 25- to 70-fold compared with the wild type). Using a similar procedure, the mRNA levels of five putative targets of WRI1 were then analysed in these tissues. The genes considered encoded the BCCP2 subunit of heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase (At5g15530), plastidial pyruvate kinases PKp-α (At3g22960) and PKp-β1 (At5g52920), phosphoglycerate mutase (PhoM, At1g22170) and enolase (ENOp, At1g74030). The five genes appeared to be significantly overexpressed in <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> siliques (<a href="#f2" rel="references:#f2" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 2</a>). However, the increase in mRNA accumulation measured for these target genes of WRI1 (1.5–3-fold increase on average, depending on the gene considered) was limited in comparison with the increase in <em>WRI1</em> mRNA level observed in the same lines (see above). To test the impact of these increased mRNA levels on seed physiology, corresponding enzymatic activities were measured in maturing seeds aged 16 DAA (<a href="#t2" rel="references:#t2" class="tableLink" title="Link to table" shape="rect">Table 2</a>). Pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase and enolase activities were thus investigated: none of these enzymatic activities appeared to be significantly increased in <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> seeds. Likewise, the TAG content of mature transgenic seeds was not improved compared with the wild-type content (<a href="#t2" rel="references:#t2" class="tableLink" title="Link to table" shape="rect">Table 2</a>).</p>

          <div class="para">
            <p>In order to gain further insights into the regulation of WRI1 targets, two of these genes, namely <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em>, were considered for an in-depth characterization of their transcriptional regulation. A quantitative RT-PCR approach was first carried out to finely characterize the relative mRNA accumulation profiles of these genes in a developmental series of wild-type siliques of the Columbia (Col-0) accession, ranging from 4 to 22 DAA (<a href="#f3" rel="references:#f3" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 3a</a>). The two genes studied exhibited identical patterns. Both <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> relative transcript levels were relatively low during early silique development (up to 6 DAA). A sharp increase in expression was observed from 6 to 12 DAA, corresponding to the onset of seed maturation. Then, mRNA levels gradually decreased throughout the mid-maturation phase (12–18 DAA), and remained low during late maturation (18–22 DAA). The <em>WRI1</em> relative mRNA accumulation profile was determined on the same developmental series (<a href="#f3" rel="references:#f3" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 3b</a>). The profile obtained was very similar to the ones described above for <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em>. However, the successive rise and fall in <em>WRI1</em> relative mRNA levels were both initiated slightly earlier than the corresponding increase and decrease in <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> transcript levels. The peak in <em>WRI1</em> expression was consequently observed at 10 DAA. These observations were fully consistent with the hypothesized function of WRI1 in triggering the transcription of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em>. In addition, these results were confirmed using cDNAs obtained from a developmental series of isolated seeds ranging from 6 to 18 DAA (Figure S1).</p>

          <h4>Patterns of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoter activity in <em>wri</em>1 and <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> backgrounds</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>To further evaluate the impact of changes in <em>WRI1</em> mRNA levels on the patterns of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoter activity, promoter fragments of 523 bp (<em>PKp-β1</em>) and 580 bp (<em>BCCP2</em>) were fused translationally to the <em>uidA</em> reporter gene. The chimerical constructs were assayed for their expression in transgenic <em>A. thaliana</em> lines, and we checked that the profiles of GUS activity thus obtained were consistent with the profiles of mRNA accumulation previously observed using qRT-PCR (see above). In a wild-type background, <em>Pro</em><sub><em>PKp-β1-423</em></sub> and <em>Pro</em><sub><em>BCCP2-580</em></sub> activities were detected in maturing embryos (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4a</a>). The staining observed was intense both in the hypocotyl and in the cotyledons of the embryo. On the contrary, neither <em>Pro</em><sub><em>PKp-β1-423</em></sub> nor <em>Pro</em><sub><em>BCCP2-580</em></sub> activity could be detected in leaf blades from the rosette (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4b</a>). The constructs were then introduced into <em>wri1-1</em> and <em>wri1-3</em> mutant backgrounds to test whether these mutations could affect the activity of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoters. In contrast to the observations in wild-type plants, neither <em>Pro</em><sub><em>PKp-β1-423</em></sub> nor <em>Pro</em><sub><em>BCCP2-580</em></sub> activity could be detected in maturing <em>wri1</em> embryos (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4a</a>). The constructs were finally introduced in two independent <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> overexpressing lines (T63 and T81). As <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> are already expressed at high levels in maturing seeds of the wild type, testing an increased induction of <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> transcription by WRI1 overexpression in this tissue was not convenient. On the contrary, it was possible to observe a strong induction of both <em>Pro</em><sub><em>PKp-β1-423</em></sub> and <em>Pro</em><sub><em>BCCP2-580</em></sub> activities in rosette leaves (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4b</a>). These results established that WRI1 is necessary and sufficient to enhance the activity of both <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>BCCP2</em> promoters <em>in planta</em>.</p>

          <h4>Isolation of key regulatory elements in the promoters of <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em></h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>To identify the domains within the 580-bp <em>BCCP2</em> promoter that might be important for the transcriptional regulation of tissue specificity, 5′ deletions were generated and translational fusions to the <em>uidA</em> reporter gene were constructed. For each construct, several stable transformants were obtained and analysed for GUS activity (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4c</a>). Deletions to positions −402, −202 and −180 did not affect the <em>uidA</em> expression pattern and apparent intensity. Deletions to positions −168 and −160 did not affect the <em>uidA</em> expression pattern in mid-maturing embryos, but apparent intensity was markedly decreased, so that the GUS activity could not be detected in young torpedo-shaped embryos. The GUS activity was further decreased, with deletion to position −147: the staining observed in maturing embryos was extremely pale. A further deletion to position −126 resulted in a complete loss of GUS activity. These observations led us to conclude that the region between −180 and −126 contained key elements necessary for the induction of <em>BCCP2</em> in maturing embryos of <em>A. thaliana</em>. A similar approach was then carried out to identify domains within the 523-bp <em>PKp-β1</em> promoter that might be important for its transcriptional regulation (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4d</a>). Deletions to positions −422, −317, −274, −266 and −246 did not affect the <em>uidA</em> expression pattern and apparent intensity. Deletion to positions −233 did not affect the <em>uidA</em> expression pattern, but the apparent intensity was decreased. A further deletion to position −177 resulted in an almost complete loss of GUS activity: a faint staining could be detected in some cotyledon and hypocotyl cells of mid-maturing embryos. These data strongly suggest that the region between −256 and −177 contained some of the elements necessary for induction of <em>PKp-β1</em> in maturing embryos of <em>A. thaliana</em>. A comparison of the two promoter regions thus identified was then undertaken to isolate common <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements putatively involved in the simultaneous induction of both <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> (<a href="#f5" rel="references:#f5" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 5a</a>). A 15-bp sequence (5′-CAAAAGGAGCGGTTT-3′) was detected in the promoter of <em>BCCP2</em> between −179 and −165 that was very similar to the 15-bp sequence (5′-CAAAAGTACGAGTTT-3′) present in the <em>PKp-β1</em> promoter between −253 and −239. In each of the promoter regions considered, a second version, slightly less conserved, of this 15-bp motif was observed, either on the plus strand (<em>BCCP2</em>) or on the minus strand (<em>PKp-β1</em>) of the DNA sequence examined. Finally, database comparison using PLACE showed the presence of soybean embryo factor 3 (SEF3) recognition sequences (<a href="#b2" rel="references:#b2" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Allen <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>) in each of the two promoter regions studied. Interestingly, these SEF3 motifs were entirely (<em>BCCP2</em>) or partially (<em>PKp-β1</em>) included in one of the 15-bp motifs described above.</p>

          <h4>Characterization of the key regulatory elements identified in the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>Deletion series of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter have shown that nucleotides from −180 to −126 contain a seed-specific enhancer. This promoter region encompasses two 15-bp motifs, the complete removal of which dramatically decreases the activity of the promoter <em>in planta</em> (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4c</a>). To further investigate the role of these motifs, the effects of mutations in these key regulatory elements were tested in the context of a 202-bp promoter cloned in front of the <em>uidA</em> reporter gene. The motifs of interest were altered by <em>in vitro</em> mutagenesis, as summarized in <a href="#f5" rel="references:#f5" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 5(b)</a>: the primers used were designed so as to obtain a specific alteration of conserved nucleotides without compromising the hybridization of these primers. The effects of the mutations on promoter function were tested in stable transformants (<a href="#f6" rel="references:#f6" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 6</a>). A gene construct that included seven nucleotide changes in the 15-bp motif at position −179 (mutation m1) did not result in significant changes of GUS activity in maturing embryos. Likewise, a gene construct including eight nucleotide changes in the 15-bp motif at position −151 (mutation m2) did not modify the GUS pattern in maturing embryos. Interestingly, when these two set of nucleotide changes were combined (mutation m1 + m2), the <em>uidA</em> expression pattern remained unaffected, but the apparent intensity was markedly decreased throughout the maturation phase, so that GUS activity was not detected in young torpedo-shaped embryos. These observations confirmed the importance of the 15-bp regulatory elements previously identified. They also suggested that these rather long consensus sites tolerate variations of their nucleotide sequences, and retain some activity even when partially modified by mutagenesis.</p>

          <h4>Interaction of WRI1 with the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>Analysis of the interaction between WRI1 and the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter was firstly performed using a yeast one-hybrid approach. Yeast strains that presented the <em>HIS3</em> reporter gene under the control of a <em>BANYULS (BAN</em>; <em>At1g61720</em>), <em>HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE1</em> (<em>HSD1</em>, <em>At5g50600</em>) (both used as negative controls) or <em>BCCP2</em> promoter were constructed and transformed with different plasmids, allowing the expression of WRI1 or its closest homologue At2g41710 (<a href="#f7" rel="references:#f7" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 7a</a>). A transformation of the strains presenting the <em>HIS3</em> reporter gene under the control of <em>BAN</em> or <em>HSD1</em> promoters with WRI1 fused to the GAL4 activation domain (AD) gave no positive interaction results, showing that WRI1 was not able to interact with these promoters used as negative controls. On the contrary, the expression of WRI1 fused to AD in the strain presenting the <em>HIS3</em> reporter gene under the control of the <em>BCCP2</em> minimal promoter (180 bp) resulted in the specific growth of the strain on medium lacking histidine, thus demonstrating the interaction between WRI1 and this promoter sequence. This interaction seemed to be specific, as the closest homologue of WRI1, namely At2g41710 (<a href="#b19" rel="references:#b19" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Feng <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>), was not able to interact with the <em>BCCP2</em> minimal promoter. A second set of experiments was then designed in order to determine whether the drastic reduction of promoter activity observed when short versions (&lt;180 bp) of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter were fused to the <em>uidA</em> reporter gene (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4c</a>) could be correlated with a reduced interaction with WRI1. Yeast strains that presented the <em>HIS3</em> reporter gene under the control of various versions of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter were thus transformed with WRI1 fused to AD (<a href="#f7" rel="references:#f7" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 7b</a>). When grown on a selective medium lacking histidine and containing 25 m<span class="smallCaps">m</span> 3-aminotriazole (AT), strains presenting a 160-bp version of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter exhibited very limited growth compared with the strains containing a 180-bp minimal promoter. Strains presenting a 126-bp version of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter were not able to grow on this medium. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the strength of the interaction between WRI1 and the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter could be modulated by nucleotide elements located in the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter, between −180 and −126.</p>

            <p>To independently verify the one-hybrid results that suggested there was an interaction between WRI1 and the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter, electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSAs) were performed. A recombinant WRI1 DNA-binding domain (DBD) was produced, and EMSAs were performed using the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter (DNA fragment corresponding to the region from −193 to −127 bp, relative to the <em>BCCP2</em> translational start codon) as the probe (<a href="#f8" rel="references:#f8" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 8</a>).

          <h4>WRI1 directly enhances the expression of genes involved in glycolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>Factors controlling the overall level of oil stored in seeds of <em>A. thaliana</em>, and the integration of this biochemical process in the complex framework of seed development, are only partially characterized (<a href="#b47" rel="references:#b47" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Santos Mendoza <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>). Complementary expression analyses and transcriptomic approaches have demonstrated that the biosynthetic pathways for fatty acids and lipids are largely regulated at the transcriptional level in maturing seeds (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). The ‘contrapuntal’ or differential timing of the expression of genes involved in oil metabolism during seed development most probably reflects distinct regulatory pathways controlling the transcription of different sets of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and TAG assembly, respectively. As groups of enzymes within a pathway sometimes exhibit similar regulation, it has been postulated that those members of a given pathway might share common <em>cis-</em> and <em>trans</em>-regulatory elements. For instance, a number of genes encoding enzymes of the glycolysis and the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway display a bell-shaped pattern of expression between 5 and 13 DAA (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). This is corroborated in our study by qRT-PCR experiments aimed at characterizing the steady-state accumulation of <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> mRNAs among a developmental series of maturing siliques (<a href="#f3" rel="references:#f3" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 3a</a>) or seeds (Figure S1). The WRI1 transcription factor, previously shown to represent a node in the regulatory network controlling oilseed metabolism (<a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>), was proposed to trigger the transcription of the set of genes involved in the conversion of sucrose into fatty acids. This hypothesis was based on the analysis of the expression profiles of putative target genes of WRI1 characterized in various <em>wri1</em> mutant backgrounds, and in tissues overexpressing <em>WRI1</em> ectopically (<a href="#b45" rel="references:#b45" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ruuska <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>; <a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>). In this study, the use of the <em>uidA</em> reporter gene, the expression of which is driven by full-length promoter sequences of either <em>BCCP2</em> or <em>PKp-β1</em>, further establishes that WRI1 is able to strongly modulate the activity of these two promoters <em>in planta</em> (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4a,b</a>). Finally, EMSA (<a href="#f8" rel="references:#f8" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 8</a>) and yeast one-hybrid experiments (<a href="#f7" rel="references:#f7" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 7a</a>) demonstrate that WRI1 is able to interact with the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter, strongly suggesting that this gene is a direct target of WRI1 <em>in</em> <em>planta</em>. It is noteworthy that the fine characterization of the changes in mRNA accumulation for <em>BCCP2</em>, <em>PKp-β1</em> and <em>WRI1</em> throughout silique development shows that the induction of the regulatory factor precedes the induction of its targets in the Col-0 accession (<a href="#f3" rel="references:#f3" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 3</a>). This slight delay in the detection of mRNAs corresponding to target genes of WRI1 may presumably illustrate biochemical processes occurring in embryo cells, such as translation of the WRI1 peptide, and post-translational regulations (e.g. translocation of WRI1 towards the nucleus or putative recruitment of its interacting partners).</p>

          <div class="para">
            <p>Whereas <a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning (2004)</a> have reported that expression of <em>WRI1</em> cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S-promoter leads to slightly increased seed oil content, neither the <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> nor the <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> transgene used in the present study efficiently stimulates oil accumulation in the corresponding transgenic seeds (<a href="#t1" rel="references:#t1 #t2" class="tableLink" title="Link to tables" shape="rect">Tables 1 and 2</a>). Several factors like growth conditions or strength and specificity of the different promoters used (classical <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35S</em></sub> versus <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub> or <em>Pro</em><sub><em>S2</em></sub>) may explain these apparent discrepancies. However, it is also interesting to note that the transgenes considered have been introduced in different <em>A. thaliana</em> accessions (Col-0 versus Ws backgrounds). In the Ws background (this study), the endogenous expression level of glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic genes is significantly higher than in the Col-0 accession (Figure S1). Likewise, fatty acid concentration is more elevated in mature dry seeds of the Ws accession (see <a href="#f1" rel="references:#f1" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 1c</a> in <a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that expression of lipogenic genes may be more limiting in a Col-0 background than in a Ws background.</p>

          <h4>The transcriptional machinery controlling the lipogenic pathway may be composed of multiple and distinct activating factors</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>When considering the mRNA levels of target genes of WRI1 in a <em>wri1</em> null mutant background (e.g. <em>wri1-5</em>), it is interesting to note that the relative accumulation of these transcripts is dramatically altered, although not completely abolished (see <a href="#f6" rel="references:#f6" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 6</a> in <a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>), suggesting that basal transcriptional activity of these lipogenic genes still occurs. This is certainly the reason why <em>wri1</em> seeds are still able to synthesize and store appreciable quantities of fatty acids (30–45% of the wild-type content, depending on the allele considered; <a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>). Two main hypotheses can be put forward to explain this remnant transcriptional activity. First, transcription factors of the AP2/EREBP family, closely related to WRI1, may be able to substitute for WRI1, binding its target promoters and triggering the transcription of the corresponding lipogenic genes. In this case, the low abundance of mRNAs for target genes of WRI1 observed in <em>wri1</em> seeds may be explained by a low affinity of the substitute transcription factor(s) for the <em>cis</em>-elements usually bound by WRI1 and/or by a low abundance of this (these) substitute element(s). To test this hypothesis, we recently investigated the function of the closest homologue of WRI1 among the AP2 family, which is encoded by the gene <em>At2g41710</em> (<a href="#b19" rel="references:#b19" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Feng <em>et al.</em>, 2005</a>). Transgenic lines overexpressing this gene ectopically were prepared, homozygous mutants were isolated, and these mutant lines were then crossed with <em>wri1</em> to generate double mutants. This material was subjected to fine physiological and metabolic analyses: it appeared that <em>At2g41710</em> does not participate in the induction of target genes of WRI1 (SB, unpublished data). The inability of the At2g41710 protein to interact with the promoter of <em>BCCP2</em> (<a href="#f8" rel="references:#f8" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 8a</a>) is in agreement with these data. Although the model involving substitute factors homologous with WRI1 to explain a basal and WRI1-independent transcription activity of lipogenic genes cannot be completely ruled out, the observations previously mentioned make it most unlikely. An alternative hypothesis may involve one or several constitutively expressed activator(s) of the glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways that would be unrelated to WRI1, and would ensure a basal activation of these pathways in every plant cell. This operating system would be sufficient to provide the fatty acid pool required to ensure housekeeping functions. In this model, WRI1 would behave as a transcriptional enhancer, boosting fatty acid synthesis in specific tissues where the demand for fatty acids is high, as in the TAG-accumulating tissues of the maturing embryo. According to this model, the activator(s) and the enhancer would bind distinct <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements within the promoter of lipogenic genes. A progressive removal of these <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements may explain the gradual loss of activity observed when shortening the <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> promoters (<a href="#f4" rel="references:#f4" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 4c,d</a>). Finally, the poor over-accumulation (1.5–3-fold increase, depending on the gene considered) of the transcripts encoding lipogenic enzymes observed in transgenic seeds overexpressing <em>WRI1</em> to high levels (25–70-fold increase; <a href="#f2" rel="references:#f2" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 2</a>) might be the consequence of a limiting abundance of these transcriptional activators, which also constitute key elements of the transcriptional machinery. Obviously, other mechanisms relying on negative feedback modulating the stability of <em>WRI1</em> mRNAs, translation, and/or half-life of WRI1 proteins may also explain this phenomenon. These aspects should be further investigated with care. For this purpose, the development of tools allowing the detection and quantification of WRI1 proteins will be valuable.</p>

          <h4>Identification of a <em>cis</em>-regulatory element required for the induction of the glycolytic and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways in seeds</h4>
          <div class="para">
            <p>Functional dissections of the <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> promoters have led to the identification of enhancing regions of 54 and 79 bp, respectively, that are essential to direct the activity of these promoters in oil-accumulating tissues of the embryo. Comparison of these enhancer elements using PLACE reveals the presence of shared nucleotide sequences that may constitute putative recognition sequences bound by the transcriptional machinery triggering fatty acid biosynthesis. The hexanucleotide AACCCA that can be observed on the minus strand of each enhancer element has previously been described as the core of the SEF3-recognition sequence (<a href="#b2" rel="references:#b2" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Allen <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>). This DNA binding factor was identified in nuclear extracts from developing soybean seeds, and was initially presented as a positive regulator of transcription of the β-conglycinin, α-subunit gene. SEF3-like activities were reported in seeds of other oleaginous species, such as tobacco and sunflower (<a href="#b30" rel="references:#b30" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Lessard <em>et al.</em>, 1991</a>). In soybean, SEF3 was shown to bind specifically to a site composed of two AACCCA elements separated by 27 bp (<a href="#b2" rel="references:#b2" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Allen <em>et al.</em>, 1989</a>). Nevertheless, complementary studies then established that mutations abolishing the protein binding of this SEF3 factor <em>in vitro</em> did not affect the <em>in vivo</em> promoter activity in a significant manner (<a href="#b22" rel="references:#b22" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Fujiwara and Beachy, 1994</a>). Similarly, in this study, we show that mutations in the AACCCA element of the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter (m2; <a href="#f5" rel="references:#f5" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 5b</a>) do not impact on promoter activity (<a href="#f6" rel="references:#f6" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 6</a>). These results strongly suggest that isolated core SEF3 recognition sequences do not constitute essential <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of the lipogenic pathway.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="para">
            <p>By carefully analysing the results of the functional dissections carried out on the enhancer regions of the <em>BCCP2</em> and <em>PKp-β1</em> promoters, it is possible to identify a DNA sequence highly conserved between the two promoters that is important for their activity (<a href="#f5" rel="references:#f5" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 5</a>). This 15-bp motif is also found in the promoters of other putative target genes of WRI1 encoding the PDH-E1β (At2g34590) and PDH-E1α (At1g01090) subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, or the plastidial phosphoglycerate mutase At1g22170, which were previously shown to respond to variations of the <em>WRI1</em> transcript level (<a href="#b10" rel="references:#b10" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud <em>et al.</em>, 2007a</a>). The consensus site thus defined is 5′-cAAAAG(t/g)Agg(a/g)gttT-3′. In each promoter considered, a second version of this motif, slightly less conserved, can be observed in the immediate vicinity of the first one (<a href="#f5" rel="references:#f5" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 5d</a>). The results of site-directed mutagenesis carried out on the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter suggest that these elements might be partially redundant (<a href="#f6" rel="references:#f6" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 6</a>). Consistent with this finding, one-hybrid analyses indicate that the successive removal of these two motifs in the <em>BCCP2</em> promoter gradually diminishes the strength of the interaction between WRI1 and this promoter (<a href="#f7" rel="references:#f7" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 7b</a>). Last, the low competition observed in EMSA experiments when using mutagenized <em>Pro</em><sub><em>BCCP2</em></sub> probes (<a href="#f8" rel="references:#f8" class="figureLink" title="Link to figure" shape="rect">Figure 8</a>) confirms the importance of these motifs for the binding of WRI1 to its target promoter. Interestingly, both the length and structure of the motif identified are reminiscent of the consensus binding site of the ANT protein (<a href="#b37" rel="references:#b37" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Nole-Wilson and Krizek, 2000</a>). Nevertheless, further analyses are now required to extend the predictive value of the consensus sequence identified. A close examination of the promoters of some genes encoding enzymes of the glycolysis (e.g. plastidial enolase, At1g74030) or the fatty acid biosynthetic network (e.g. KASII, At1g74960) has enabled the detection of a similar 15-bp motif (data not shown). In the case of the enolase, quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that this gene was also upregulated in <em>Pro</em><sub><em>35Sdual</em></sub><em>:WRI1</em> transgenic lines, whereas it was downregulated in <em>wri1</em> mutant seeds (data not shown). These results suggest that the 15-bp motif could be utilized in a predictive manner to identify new putative targets of WRI1. However, without a fine structure–function study that would unravel key nucleotides within this rather long and complex motif, it will be difficult to perform <em>in silico</em> analyses of the <em>A. thaliana</em> genome to identify all the promoters exhibiting such a <em>cis</em>-regulatory element. At that stage, it is consequently too early to determine whether or not the transcriptional machinery involving WRI1 co-ordinately induces all of the genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. Alternatively, master regulators of the maturation program like LEC1 might directly control some of the genes involved in lipogenesis (<a href="#b35" rel="references:#b35" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Mu <em>et al.</em>, 2008</a>).</p>

          <p>As the economic viability of using plant oils as renewable resources is critically dependent on yield, numerous biotechnological approaches have concentrated on the manipulation of the total oil content in seeds of <em>A. thaliana</em> and <em>B. napus</em>. One of the most significant improvements obtained so far results from the seed-specific overexpression of a yeast gene coding for cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (<a href="#b53" rel="references:#b53" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Vigeolas <em>et al.</em>, 2007</a>). Approaches relying on the overexpression of the genes coding acylating enzymes of the Kennedy also resulted in significant although limited improvements of the seed oil content (<a href="#b56" rel="references:#b56" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Zou <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>; <a href="#b25" rel="references:#b25" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Jain <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>; <a href="#b26" rel="references:#b26" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Jako <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>; <a href="#b51" rel="references:#b51" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>).

To date, attempts to stimulate fatty acid production by overexpression of individual genes involved in <em>de novo</em> fatty acid biosynthesis have been unsuccessful, even under controlled growth conditions (<a href="#b17" rel="references:#b17" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Dehesh <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>; <a href="#b52" rel="references:#b52" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Thelen and Ohlrogge, 2002</a>). These setbacks suggest that a transcriptional activation of the entire fatty acid biosynthetic network may be required to enhance the rate of acyl-chain production (<a href="#b7" rel="references:#b7" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud and Lepiniec, 2009</a>). The WRI1 transcription factor, regarded as a central regulator of the lipogenic pathway, may thus constitute an effective tool towards manipulating the quantity of fatty acids produced in seeds (<a href="#b40" rel="references:#b40" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Ohlrogge and Jaworski, 1997</a>; <a href="#b16" rel="references:#b16" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Cernac and Benning, 2004</a>). To fully exploit this tool, it is now urgent to further characterize the transcriptional machinery regulating the lipogenic pathway in plants (<a href="#b6" rel="references:#b6" class="referenceLink" title="Link to bibliographic citation" shape="rect">Baud and Lepiniec, 2008</a>). Identification of protein partners of WRI1, if any, and of the motifs bound by these regulatory elements will undoubtedly constitute useful pieces of information for the design of new transgenic plants. Ultimately, the combination of constructs driving the seed-specific overexpression of transcription factors regulating the lipogenic pathway, and of key enzymes involved in TAG assembly, may appear as an efficient approach to obtain oleaginous seeds with improved agronomic traits.</p>

          <p><b>Figure S1.</b> Comparison of <em>BCCP2</em>, <em>PKp-ß1</em>, and <em>WRI1</em> transcript levels in developing seeds<em>.</em> Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the relative mRNA levels of <em>BCCP2</em> (&amp;bsl00001;) and <em>PKp-ß1</em> (&amp;U25CF;), were performed in seeds of the Col-0 (a) and Ws (b) accessions. The relative mRNA level of <em>WRI1</em> was investigated in parallel in Col-0 (c) and Ws (d) accessions. The results obtained are standardised to the constitutive <em>EF1αA4</em> gene expression level. Three technical replications were carried out with each cDNA population considered. Values are the means ± SE of three measurements.</p>
