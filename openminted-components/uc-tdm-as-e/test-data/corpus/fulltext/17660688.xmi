During sexual reproduction, double fertilization produces the embryo and endosperm, which both contain maternally and paternally derived genomes. In endosperm, a reproductive barrier is often observed in inter-specific crosses. Endosperm is a tissue that provides nourishment for the embryo within the seed, in a similar fashion to the placenta of mammals, and for the young seedling after germination. This review considers the relationship between the reproductive barrier in endosperm and genomic imprinting. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism that results in mono-allelic gene expression that is parent-of-origin dependent. In Arabidopsis, recent studies of several imprinted gene loci have identified the epigenetic mechanisms that determine genomic imprinting. A crucial feature of genomic imprinting is that the maternally and paternally derived imprinted genes must carry some form of differential mark, usually DNA methylation and/or histone modification. Although the epigenetic marks should be complementary on maternally and paternally imprinted genes within a single species, it is possible that neither the patterns of epigenetic marks nor expression of imprinted genes are the same in different species. Moreover, in hybrid endosperm, the regulation of expression of imprinted genes can be affected by upstream regulatory mechanisms in the male and female gametophytes. Species-specific variations in epigenetic marks, the copy number of imprinted genes, and the epigenetic regulation of imprinted genes in hybrids might all play a role in the reproductive barriers observed in the endosperm of interspecific and interploidy crosses. These predicted molecular mechanisms might be related to earlier models such as the &quot;endosperm balance number&quot; (EBN) and &quot;polar nuclei activation&quot; (PNA) hypotheses.Tetsu Kinoshita"/>
