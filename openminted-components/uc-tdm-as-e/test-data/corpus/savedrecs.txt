TI Characterization of 4 TaGAST genes during spike development and seed
   germination and their response to exogenous phytohormones in common
   wheat
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS
AB Gibberellic acid (GA) is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. We defined GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) gene family and characterized its four members (TaGAST1, 2, 3, and 4) in wheat spikes. Triticum aestivum whole spikes were collected at ten developmental stages and dehulled spikelets were obtained at various days after flowering. Expression of TaGAST1, 2, 3, and 4 was analyzed using RT-PCR at inflorescence development stages, in different tissues, and after phytohormones application. To identify proteins interacting with TaGAST1, yeast two-hybridization was performed and BiFC analysis was used for verification. TaGAST1 was expressed at the inflorescence stage and only expressed in seedlings under abscisic acid (ABA) treatment after phytohormone treatment. TaGAST2 and TaGAST3 showed moderate expression in the spike, vigorous transcript accumulation in the seedling, and up-regulation by exogenous GA in early germination stages. TaGAST4 was predominantly expressed in the seedling. Wheat cyclophilin A-1 (TaCypA1), identified as a TaGAST1-interacting protein, showed opposite expression pattern in the developing spike to TaGAST1. TaCypA1 transcript was slightly up-regulated by GA, slightly down-regulated by paclobutrazol, and was maintained after ABA treatment. The interaction of TaGAST1 with TaCypA1 is targeted to the plasma membrane. TaGAST1 was specifically expressed in the wheat spike and was stimulated by exogenous GA treatment. TaGAST2 and TaGAST3 expression in germinating seeds and seedlings was higher than that in the spike stage. TaGAST4 was not expressed in all developmental stages. TaGAST1 and TaCypA1 might be expressed antagonistically during wheat spike development.

TI Glucose ester enabled acylation in plant specialized metabolism
SO PHYTOCHEMISTRY REVIEWS
CT PSNA Meeting
CY AUG 08-12, 2015
CL IL
SP PSNA
AB Acylation of core compound skeletons, together with other modifications, plays a significant role in producing the incredible diversity of plant specialized metabolites. Two major classes of acyltransferases, the BAHD and serine carboxypeptidase-like (SCPL) acyltransferases, can bring together through acylation compounds from the same or divergent metabolic pathways. BAHD acyltransferases (BAHD-ATs) employ CoA thioesters as the activated substrate, SCPL acyltransferases (SCPL-ATs), on the other hand, utilize beta-acetal esters, typically glucose esters formed by UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs). While the general trend of high energy glucose ester enabled acyltransfers is seen throughout the spermatophytes (seed plants), the specific metabolites that are conjugated appear to be lineage specific. In this review, we examine the reaction mechanism, biochemical property and evolutionary relationship of SCPL-ATs that utilize various glucose ester donors and acceptors from the same or different plant specialized metabolic pathways. The occurrence and taxonomic distribution of galloylated flavan-3-ols, hydrolyzable tannins and galloylated flavonols are also evaluated. Furthermore, glucose ester (acyl donor)-forming UGT activities and the subcellular localization of the UGT and SCPL-AT catalyzed reactions are discussed.

TI SlTIR1 is involved in crosstalk of phytohormones, regulates
   auxin-induced root growth and stimulates stenospermocarpic fruit
   formation in tomato
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB TIR1 and its homologs act as auxin receptors and play important roles in plant growth and development in Arabidopsis thaliana. An auxin receptor homolog Solanum lycopersicum TIR1 (SlTIR1) has been isolated from tomato cultivar Micro-Tom, and SlTIR1 over-expression results in parthenocarpic fruit formation. In this study, the promoter driving the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) expression vector was constructed and stably transformed into Micro-Tom seedlings. The SlTIR1 promoter driving GUS expression accumulated predominantly in the leaf and vasculature in transgenic seedlings. Promoter analysis identified an auxin-response element (AuxRE) and two gibberellic acid (GA)-response elements in the SlTIR1 promoter. Quantitative PCR showed that SlTIR1 transcript level was down-regulated by naphthaleneacetic acid, ethephon and abscisic acid and up-regulated by GA. Furthermore, because of the lack of ability to form reproductive seeds in SlTIR1 over-expressing Micro-Tom, this limits further exploration of potential roles of SlTIR1 in auxin signaling. Here, an antisense vector and an over-expression vector of the SlTIR1 gene were stably transformed into Micro-Tom and Ailsa Craig tomato, respectively. Phenotypes and physiological analyses indicated that SlTIR1 regulated primary root growth and auxin-associated lateral root formation in Micro-Tom. Meanwhile, SlTIR1 also stimulated abnormal seed development, so-called stenospermocarpy, in Ailsa Craig. Transcript accumulations of auxin-signaling genes determined by quantitative PCR were consistent with the idea that SlTIR1 regulated plant growth and development, partially mediated by controlling the mRNA levels of auxin-signaling genes. Our work demonstrates that SlTIR1 regulated auxin-induced root growth and stimulated stenospermocarpic fruit formation. SlTIR1 may be a key mediator of the crosstalk among auxin and other hormones to co-regulate plant growth and development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI An ABC transporter, OsABCG26, is required for anther cuticle and pollen
   exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Wax, cutin and sporopollenin are essential components for the formation of the anther cuticle and the pollen exine, respectively. Their lipid precursors are synthesized by secretory tapetal cells and transported to the anther and microspore surface for deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of the anther cuticle and pollen exine are poorly understood in rice. Here, we characterized a rice male sterile mutant osabcg26. Molecular cloning and sequence analysis revealed a point mutation in the gene encoding an ATP binding cassette transporter G26 (OsABCG26). OsABCG26 was specifically expressed in the anther and pistil. Cytological analysis revealed defects in tapetal cells, lipidic Ubisch bodies, pollen exine, and anther cuticle in the osabcg26 mutant. Expression of some key genes involved in lipid metabolism and transport, such as UDT1, WDA1, CYP704B2, OsABCG15, OsC4 and OsC6, was significantly altered in osabcg26 anther, possibly due to a disturbance in the homeostasis of anther lipid metabolism and transport. Additionally, wild-type pollen tubes showed a growth defect in osabcg26 pistils, leading to low seed setting in osabcg26 cross-pollinated with the wild-type pollen. These results indicated that OsABCG26 plays an important role in anther cuticle and pollen exine formation and pollen-pistil interactions in rice. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

TI WSA206, a paralog of duplicated MPF2-like MADS-box family is recruited
   in fertility function in Withania
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Best known for their implication in calyx inflation, MPF2-like genes pertinent to the STMADS11 Glade of the MADS-box family exert their functions in leaf development, flowering time, inflorescence architecture and floral reversion to just name but a few. However, our knowledge about their involvement in fertility function remained obscure. Therefore the major thrust of this study was to probe the recruitment of WSA206 (MPF2-like) protein in fertility function. The WSA206 functions were revealed by knocking down and overexpressing this protein in Withania somnifera. The WSA206 promoter functions were defined by stable integration in Arabidopsis using GUS tag. The interactions of WSA206 were investigated by screening Arabidopsis Oligo-dT yeast library and YFP-split analysis. WSA206 knockdown plants revealed fewer flowers, abortion in seed set, reduction in pollen number and deformed non-viable pollen in comparison with wild type counterparts. Overexpression of WSA206 in Withania generated more berries/seeds and healthier viable pollen grains. Remarkably, along with fertility control, the impairment in calyx inflation in knockdown Withania plants and extraordinary growth of sepals in overexpression lines is observed. Thus, fertility and calyx inflation are tightly coupled traits under the control of WSA206. Coding sequence revealed SNP mutations from arginine to lysine as well as a leucine-rich motif duplication at the C-terminus, a characteristic feature of pollen specific and fertility function proteins. The protein-protein interaction spectrum of WSA206 comprises 40% of those MADS and non-MADS-box proteins implicated in floral anther expression and embryogenesis. Predominant WSA206 promoter:GUS expression accrued in the anthers/pollen may be attributed to of the presence of GAAATTGTTA pollen specific proximal motifs along with several other anther specific homotypic cis-clusters. MPF2-like protein WSA206 through interactions with MADS-box and non-MADS-domain proteins confers male fertility in Withania regulated by anther/pollen specific promoter motif GAAATTGTTA.

TI Ectopic expression of a soybean SVP-like gene in tobacco causes abnormal
   floral organs and shortens the vegetative phase
SO PLANT GROWTH REGULATION
AB MADS-box family transcription factors play critical roles in regulating plant developmental processes. SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP), a MADS-box family member, was demonstrated to be a key regulator in floral transition and identity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The present study isolated and characterized two soybean SVP-like genes, GmSVP1 and GmSVP2. A molecular sequence analysis demonstrated that each GmSVP protein contains a typical MADS_MEF2-like domain and a K-box region domain. GmSVPs are closely related to MtSVP and PsSVP but more distantly to AtSVP within the dicot SVP homology sub-clade. Quantitative real-time PCR assays showed intense expression of GmSVPs in floral organs, stamens and pistils during soybean flowering but no expression in soybean developing seeds or in the pod shell. In addition, GmSVP1 responded to abiotic stresses including low temperature and wounding. Ectopic expression of GmSVP1 caused the abnormal development of stamens, petals, and flower buds and slightly accelerated the flowering time in transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum). These results suggested that GmSVP1 acts as a regulator in soybean floral identity and flowering, which may be applied to the industrialization of hybrid soybean.

TI N availability modulates the role of NPF3.1, a gibberellin transporter,
   in GA-mediated phenotypes in Arabidopsis
SO PLANTA
AB AtNPF3.1 gene expression is promoted by limiting nitrogen nutrition. Atnpf3.1 mutants are affected in hypocotyl elongation and seed germination under conditions of low-nitrate availability.
   The NITRATE TRANSPORTER1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER (NPF) family encodes nitrate or peptides transporters, some of which are also able to transport hormones. AtNPF3.1 has been described as a nitrate/nitrite/gibberellin transporter. Until now only its gibberellins (GAs) transport capacity have been proven in planta. We further analyzed its substrate specificity towards different GA species using a yeast heterologous system which revealed that (1) NPF3.1 transported not only bioactive GAs but also their precursors and metabolites and (2) the GAs' import activity of NPF3.1 was not affected by the presence of exogenous nitrate. Gene expression analysis along with germination assays and hypocotyl length measurements of loss of function mutants was used to understand the in planta role of NPF3.1. GUS staining revealed that this gene is expressed mainly in the endodermis of roots and hypocotyls, in shoots, stamens, and dry seeds. Germination assays in the presence of paclobutrazol, a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, revealed that the germination rate of npf3.1 mutants was lower compared to wild type when GA was added at the same time. Likewise, hypocotyl length measurements showed that the npf3.1 mutants were less sensitive to exogenous GA addition in the presence of paclobutrazol, compared to wild type. Moreover, this phenotype was observed only when plants were grown on low-nitrate supply. In addition, NPF3.1 gene expression was upregulated by low exogenous nitrate concentrations and the npf3.1 mutants exhibited a not yet described GA-related phenotype under these conditions. All together, these results indicated that NPF3.1 is indeed involved in GAs transport in planta under low-nitrate conditions.

TI A Non-specific Setaria italica Lipid Transfer Protein Gene Plays a
   Critical Role under Abiotic Stress
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are a class of cysteine-rich soluble proteins having small molecular weights. LTPs participate in flower and seed development, cuticular wax deposition, also play important roles in pathogen and abiotic stress responses. A non-specific LTP gene (SiLTP) was isolated from a foxtail millet (Setaria italica) suppression subtractive hybridization library enriched for differentially expressed genes after abiotic stress treatments. A semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis showed that SiLTP was expressed in all foxtail millet tissues. Additionally, the SiLTP promoter drove GUS expression in root tips, stems, leaves, flowers, and siliques of transgenic Arabidopsis. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the SiLTP expression was induced by NaCl, polyethylene glycol, and abscisic acid (ABA). SiLTP was localized in the cytoplasm of tobacco leaf epidermal cells and maize protoplasts. The ectopic expression of SiLTP in tobacco resulted in higher levels of salt and drought tolerance than in the wild type (WT). To further assess the function of SiLTP, SiLTP overexpression (OE) and RNA interference (RNAi)-based transgenic foxtail millet were obtained. SiLTP-OE lines performed better under salt and drought stresses compared with WT plants. In contrast, the RNAi lines were much more sensitive to salt and drought compared than WT. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and yeast one-hybrids indicated that the transcription factor ABA-responsive DRE-binding protein (SiARDP) could bind to the dehydration-responsive element of SiLTP promoter in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Moreover, the SiLTP expression levels were higher in SiARDP-OE plants compared than the WT. These results confirmed that SiLTP plays important roles in improving salt and drought stress tolerance of foxtail millet, and may partly be upregulated by SiARDP. SiLTP may provide an effective genetic resource for molecular breeding in crops to enhance salt and drought tolerance levels.

TI Overexpression of TaNAC2D Displays Opposite Responses to Abiotic
   Stresses between Seedling and Mature Stage of Transgenic Arabidopsis
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Environmental stresses frequently affect plant growth and development, and many genes have been found to be induced by unfavorable environmental conditions. Here, we reported the biological functions of TaNAC2D, a stress-related NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) gene from wheat. TaNAC2D showed transcriptional activator activity in yeast. TaNAC2D-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of wheat mesophyll protoplasts. TaNAC2D transcript abundance was significantly induced by NaCl, PEG6000, and abscisic acid (ABA) at seedling stage, and repressed by NaCl and PEG6000 at mature plant stage. When TaNAC2D was introduced into Arabidopsis, the 35-day-old soil grown TaNAC2D-overexpression (TaNAC2D-OX) plants displayed slower stomatal closure, higher water loss rate, and more sensitivity to salt and drought stresses compared with WT plants. In contrast, TaNAC2D-OX seedlings, grown on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl, Mannitol, and MV, had enhanced tolerances to salt, osmotic and oxidative stresses during seed germination and post-germination periods. The opposite stress-responsive phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis were consistent with the expression patterns of TaNAC2D in wheat. Moreover, under high salinity and dehydration conditions, three marker genes, including NCED3, RD29A, and RD2913, were down regulated in 35-day-old TaNAC2D OX plants grown in soil and up-regulated in 14-day-old TaNAC2D-OX seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium. Our results suggest that the change in growth stages and environmental conditions may regulate TaNAC2D's function.

TI An ortholog of LEAFY in Jatropha curcas regulates flowering time and
   floral organ development
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Jatropha curcas seeds are an excellent biofuel feedstock, but seed yields of Jatropha are limited by its poor flowering and fruiting ability. Thus, identifying genes controlling flowering is critical for genetic improvement of seed yield. We isolated the JcLFY, a Jatropha ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana LEAFY (LFY), and identified JcLFY function by overexpressing it in Arabidopsis and Jatropha. JcLFY is expressed in Jatropha inflorescence buds, flower buds, and carpels, with highest expression in the early developmental stage of flower buds. JcLFY overexpression induced early flowering, solitary flowers, and terminal flowers in Arabidopsis, and also rescued the delayed flowering phenotype of lfy-15, a LFY loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant. Microarray and qPCR analysis revealed several flower identity and flower organ development genes were upregulated in JcLFY-overexpressing Arabidopsis. JcLFY overexpression in Jatropha also induced early flowering. Significant changes in inflorescence structure, floral organs, and fruit shape occurred in JcLFY co-suppressed plants in which expression of several flower identity and floral organ development genes were changed. This suggests JcLFY is involved in regulating flower identity, floral organ patterns, and fruit shape, although JcLFY function in Jatropha floral meristem determination is not as strong as that of Arabidopsis.

TI Transcriptome analysis revealed the dynamic oil accumulation in
   Symplocos paniculata fruit
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Symplocos paniculata, asiatic sweetleaf or sapphire berry, is a widespread shrub or small tree from Symplocaceae with high oil content and excellent fatty acid composition in fruit. It has been used as feedstocks for biodiesel and cooking oil production in China. Little transcriptome information is available on the regulatory molecular mechanism of oil accumulation at different fruit development stages.
   Results: The transcriptome at four different stages of fruit development (10, 80,140, and 170 days after flowering) of S. paniculata were analyzed. Approximately 28 million high quality clean reads were generated. These reads were trimmed and assembled into 182,904 non-redundant putative transcripts with a mean length of 592.91 bp and N50 length of 785 bp, respectively. Based on the functional annotation through Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) with public protein database, the key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism were identified, and a schematic diagram of the pathway and temporal expression patterns of lipid metabolism was established. About 13,939 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were screened out using differentially expressed sequencing (DESeq) method. The transcriptional regulatory patterns of the identified enzymes were highly related to the dynamic oil accumulation along with the fruit development of S. paniculata. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) of six vital genes was significantly correlated with DESeq data.
   Conclusions: The transcriptome sequences obtained and deposited in NCBI would enrich the public database and provide an unprecedented resource for the discovery of the genes associated with lipid metabolism pathway in S. paniculata. Results in this study will lay the foundation for exploring transcriptional regulatory profiles, elucidating molecular regulatory mechanisms, and accelerating genetic engineering process to improve the yield and quality of seed oil of S. paniculata.

TI Arabidopsis Seed Content QTL Mapping Using High-Throughput Phenotyping:
   The Assets of Near Infrared Spectroscopy
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Seed storage compounds are of crucial importance for human diet, feed and industrial uses. In oleo-proteaginous species like rapeseed, seed oil and protein are the qualitative determinants that conferred economic value to the harvested seed. To date, although the biosynthesis pathways of oil and storage protein are rather well-known, the factors that determine how these types of reserves are partitioned in seeds have to be identified. With the aim of implementing a quantitative genetics approach, requiring phenotyping of 100s of plants, our first objective was to establish near-infrared reflectance spectroscopic (NIRS) predictive equations in order to estimate oil, protein, carbon, and nitrogen content in Arabidopsis seed with high-throughput level. Our results demonstrated that NIRS is a powerful non-destructive, high-throughput method to assess the content of these four major components studied in Arabidopsis seed. With this tool in hand, we analyzed Arabidopsis natural variation for these four components and illustrated that they all displayed a wide range of variation. Finally, NIRS was used in order to map QTL for these four traits using seeds from the Arabidopsis thaliana Ct-1 x Col-0 recombinant inbred line population. Some QTL co-localized with QTL previously identified, but others mapped to chromosomal regions never identified so far for such traits. This paper illustrates the usefulness of NIRS predictive equations to perform accurate high-throughput phenotyping of Arabidopsis seed content, opening new perspectives in gene identification following QTL mapping and genome wide association studies.

TI Transcriptome analyses of seed development in grape hybrids reveals a
   possible mechanism influencing seed size
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Seedlessness in grape (Vitis vinifera) is of considerable commercial importance for both the table grape and processing industries. Studies to date of grape seed development have been made certain progress, but many key genes have yet to be identified and characterized.
   Results: In this study we analyzed the seed transcriptomes of progeny derived from the V. vinifera seeded maternal parent 'Red Globe' and the seedless paternal parent 'Centennial seedless' to identify genes associated with seedlessness. A total of 6,607 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and examined from multiple perspectives, including expression patterns, Gene Ontology ( GO) annotations, pathway enrichment, inferred hormone influence and epigenetic regulation. The expression data of hormone-related genes and hormone level measurement reveals the differences during seed development between seedless and seeded progeny. Based on both our results and previous studies of A. thaliana seed development, we generated network maps of grape seed-related DEGs, with particular reference to hormone balance, seed coat and endosperm development, and seed identity complexes.
   Conclusion: In summary, the major differences identified during seed development of seedless and seeded progeny were associated with hormone and epigenetic regulation, the development of the seed coat and endosperm, and the formation of seed identity complexes. Overall the data provides insights into the possible molecular mechanism controlling grape seed size, which is of great importance for both basic research and future translation applications in the grape industry.

TI Transcriptome analysis uncovers key regulatory and metabolic aspects of
   soybean embryonic axes during germination
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Soybean (Glycine max) is a major legume crop worldwide, providing a critical source of protein and oil. The release of the soybean genome fuelled several transcriptome projects comprising multiple developmental stages and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the global transcriptional patterns of embryonic axes during germination remain unknown. Here we report the analysis of similar to 1.58 billion RNA-Seq reads from soybean embryonic axes at five germination stages. Our results support the early activation of processes that are critical for germination, such as glycolysis, Krebs cycle and cell wall remodelling. Strikingly, only 3 hours after imbibition there is a preferential up-regulation of protein kinases and transcription factors, particularly from the LOB domain family, implying that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation play major roles early after imbibition. Lipid mobilization and glyoxylate pathways are also transcriptionally active in the embryonic axes, indicating that the local catabolism of oil reserves in the embryonic axes contributes to energy production during germination. We also present evidence supporting abscisic acid inactivation and the up-regulation of gibberellin, ethylene and brassinosteroid pathways. Further, there is a remarkable differential activation of paralogous genes in these hormone signalling pathways. Taken together, our results provide insights on the regulation and biochemistry of soybean germination.

TI The Mutation of Glu at Amino Acid 3838 of AtMDN1 Provokes Pleiotropic
   Developmental Phenotypes in Arabidopsis
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB MDN1/Rea1, as an AAA-type ATPase, is predicted to be the largest protein involved in pre-ribosome maturation in most organisms. However, its function in plant growth and development is poorly understood. Here, we characterized a novel Arabidopsis mutant, dwarf & short root (dsr) 1, which shows pleiotropic developmental phenotypes, such as slow germination, short root, dwarf shoot, and reduced seed set under normal growth conditions. Using positional cloning, we revealed that the AtMDN1 function is impaired by a 'glutamic acid' to 'lysine' change at position 3838 of the amino acid sequence in dsr1. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that the mutated Glu residue, which located in the linker domain of AtMDN1, is extremely conserved among organisms. AtMDN1 is expressed in various tissues, particularly in the shoot apex and root tip. Moreover, the results of transcript profile analyses showed that the dysfunction of AtMDN1 in dsr1 impairs the expression of genes related to plant growth and development, which is tightly associated with the pleiotropic phenotypes of dsr1. Thus, we concluded that the Glu residue plays a vital role in maintaining AtMDN1 functions, which are essential for plant growth and development.

TI Transcriptional changes during ovule development in two genotypes of
   litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) with contrast in seed size
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Litchi chinensis is a subtropical fruit crop, popular for its nutritional value and taste. Fruits with small seed size and thick aril are desirable in litchi. To gain molecular insight into gene expression that leads to the reduction in the size of seed in Litchi chinensis, transcriptomes of two genetically closely related genotypes, with contrasting seed size were compared in developing ovules. The cDNA library constructed from early developmental stages of ovules (0, 6, and 14 days after anthesis) of bold-and small-seeded litchi genotypes yielded 303,778,968 high quality paired-end reads. These were de-novo assembled into 1,19,939 transcripts with an average length of 865 bp. A total of 10,186 transcripts with contrast in expression were identified in developing ovules between the small-and large-seeded genotypes. A majority of these differences were present in ovules before anthesis, thus suggesting the role of maternal factors in seed development. A number of transcripts indicative of metabolic stress, expressed at higher level in the small seeded genotype. Several differentially expressed transcripts identified in such ovules showed homology with Arabidopsis genes associated with different stages of ovule development and embryogenesis.

TI Three Rice NAC Transcription Factors Heteromerize and Are Associated
   with Seed Size
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB NAGs are plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) involved in multiple aspects of development and stress. In rice, three NAC TF encoding genes, namely ONACO20, ONACO26, and ONACO23 express specifically during seed development, at extremely high levels. They exhibit significantly strong association with seed size/weight with the sequence variations located in the upstream regulatory region. Concomitantly, their expression pattern/levels during seed development vary amongst different accessions with variation in seed size. The alterations in the promoter sequences of the three genes, amongst the five rice accessions, correlate with the expression levels to a certain extent only. In terms of transcriptional properties, the three NAC TFs can activate and/or suppress downstream genes, though to different extents. Only ONACO26 is localized to the nucleus while ONACO20 and ONACO23 are targeted to the ER and cytoplasm, respectively. Interestingly, these two proteins interact with ONACO26 and the dimers localize in the nucleus. Trans-splicing between ONACO20 and ONACO26 results in three additional forms of ONACO20. The transcriptional properties including activation, repression, subcellular localization and heterodimerization of trans-spliced forms of ONACO20 and ONACO26 are different, indicating toward their role as competitors. The analysis presented in this paper helps to conclude that the three NAC genes, which are associated with seed size, have independent as well as overlapping roles during the process and can be exploited as potential targets for crop improvement.

TI Whole-Transcriptome Selection and Evaluation of Internal Reference Genes
   for Expression Analysis in Protocorm Development of Dendrobium
   officinale Kimura et Migo
SO PLOS ONE
AB Dendrobium officinale Kimu et Migo has increased many researchers' interest for its high medical and horticultural values and the molecular mechanism of its protocorm development remains unclear. In this study, 19 genes from 26 most stably expressed genes in whole transcriptome of protocorms and 5 housekeeping genes were used as candidate reference genes and screened with 4 application softwares (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder). The results showed that a few reference genes could effectively normalize expression level of specific genes in protocorm development and the optimal top 2 reference genes were ASS and APH1L. Meanwhile, validation of GNOM, AP2 and temperature induced gene (TIL) for normalization demonstrates the usefulness of the validated candidate reference genes. The expression profiles of these genes varied under protocorms and temperature stress according to the stablest and unstablest reference genes, which proved the importance of the choice of appropriate reference genes. The first systematic evaluation of stably expressed genes will be very useful in the future analysis of specific genes expression in D. officinale.

TI A combination of genome-wide association and transcriptome analysis
   reveals candidate genes controlling harvest index-related traits in
   Brassica napus
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Harvest index (HI), the ratio of seed mass to total biomass of the aboveground plant parts, is an important trait for harvestable yield of crops. Unfortunately, HI of Brassica napus is lower than that of other economically important crops. To identify candidate genes associated with high HI, a genome-wide association study of HI and four HI-related traits was conducted with 520 B. napus accessions cultivated in both Yunnan and Chongqing. We detected 294 single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated with the abovementioned traits, including 79 SNPs that affected two or more traits. Differentially expressed genes between extremely high-and low-HI accessions were identified in 8 tissues at two cultivated regions. Combination of linkage disequilibrium and transcriptome analyses revealed 33 functional candidate genes located within the confidence intervals of significant SNPs associated with more than one trait, such as SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 5 (Bna.SGR5), ATP-CITRATE LYASE A-3 (Bna.ACLA-3) and CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE 1 (Bna.CCD1), their orthologs in the Arabidopsis thaliana have been shown to play key roles in photosynthesis, inflorescence, and silique development. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying establishment of high-HI B. napus and lay a foundation for characterization of candidate genes aimed at developing high-HI B. napus varieties.

TI Seed Embryo Development Is Regulated via an AN3-MINI3 Gene Cascade
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB In agriculture, seed mass is one of the most important components related to seed yield. MINISEED3 (MINI3) which encodes the transcriptional activator WRKY10, is thought to be a pivotal regulator of seed mass. In Arabidopsis SHORT HYPOCOTYL UNDER BLUE1 (SHB1) associates with the promoter of MINI3, regulating embryo cell proliferation (both cell division and elongation), which, in turn, modulates seed mass. Furthermore, the recruitment of SHB1 via MINI3 to both its cognate promoter and that of IKU2 implies a two-step amplification for countering the low expression level of IKU2, which is thought to function as a molecular switch for seed cavity enlargement. However, it is largely unknown how embryo cell proliferation, which encompasses both cell division and elongation, is regulated by SHB1 and MINI3 function. Here, we show that a loss of function mutation within the transcriptional coactivator ANGUSTIFOLIA3 (AN3), increases seed mass. Further, AN3 associates with the MINI3 promoter in vivo. Genetic evidence indicates that the absence of MINI3 function suppresses the decrease of cell number observed in an3-4 mutants by regulating cell division and in turn inhibits increased cell size of the an3-4 line by controlling cell elongation. Thus, seed embryo development is modulated via an AN3-MINI3 gene cascade. This regulatory model provides a deeper understanding of seed mass regulation, which may in turn lead to increased crop yields.

TI Pre-sowing Seed Treatment with 24-Epibrassinolide Ameliorates Pesticide
   Stress in Brassica juncea L. through the Modulation of Stress Markers
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The present experiment was designed to assess the effects of seed soaking with 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiology of Brassica juncea L. seedlings grown under imidacloprid (IMI) toxicity. Application of EBR increased the length of seedlings, dry weight, and pigment contents, polyphenols, total phenols, and organic acids under IMI toxicity. The expression of genes coding key enzymes of pigment, phenols, polyphenols, and organic acid biosynthetic pathways was also studied including CHLASE (chlorophyllase), PSY (phytoene synthase), CHS (chalcone synthase) and PAL (phenylalanine ammonialyase), CS (citrate synthase), SUCLG1 (succinyl Co-A ligase,), SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), FH (fumarate hydratase), MS (malate synthase). Multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis revealed that IMI application regressed negatively on seedling length, dry weight and total chlorophyll content. However, EBR seed treatment regressed positively on all the parameters studied. Moreover, interaction between IMI and EBR showed positive regression for growth parameters, content of pigments, total polyphenol, total phenol and malate, and expression of PSY and PAL. Negative interactions were noticed for the contents of fumarate, succinate and citrate, and expression of CHS and all genes studied related to organic acid metabolism. In conclusion, EBR enhanced the growth and contents of all studied metabolites by regulating the gene expression of B. juncea seedlings under IMI stress.

TI A framework for evaluating developmental defects at the cellular level:
   An example from ten maize anther mutants using morphological and
   molecular data
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB In seed plants, anthers are critical for sexual reproduction, because they foster both meiosis and subsequent pollen development of male germinal cells. Male-sterile mutants are analyzed to define steps in anther development. Historically the major topics in these studies are meiotic arrest and post-meiotic gametophyte failure, while relatively few studies focus on pre-meiotic defects of anther somatic cells. Utilizing morphometric analysis we demonstrate that pre-meiotic mutants can be impaired in anticlinal or periclinal cell division patterns and that final cell number in the pre-meiotic anther lobe is independent of cell number changes of individual differentiated somatic cell types. Data derived from microarrays and from cell wall NMR analyses allow us to further refine our understanding of the onset of phenotypes. Collectively the data highlight that even minor deviations from the correct spatiotemporal pattern of somatic cell proliferation can result in male sterility in Zea mays. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Plant developmental responses to climate change
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Climate change is multi-faceted, and includes changing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. Here, we focus on the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, rising temperature, and drought stress and their interaction on plant developmental processes in leaves, roots, and in reproductive structures. While in some cases these responses are conserved across species, such as decreased root elongation, perturbation of root growth angle and reduced seed yield in response to drought, or an increase in root biomass in shallow soil in response to elevated CO2, most responses are variable within and between species and are dependent on developmental stage. These variable responses include species-specific thresholds that arrest development of reproductive structures, reduce root growth rate and the rate of leaf initiation and expansion in response to elevated temperature. Leaf developmental responses to elevated CO2 vary by cell type and by species. Variability also exists between C-3 and C-4 species in response to elevated CO2, especially in terms of growth and seed yield stimulation. At the molecular level, significantly less is understood regarding conservation and variability in molecular mechanisms underlying these traits. Abscisic acid-mediated changes in cell wall expansion likely underlie reductions in growth rate in response to drought, and changes in known regulators of flowering time likely underlie altered reproductive transitions in response to elevated temperature and CO2. Genes that underlie most other organ or tissue-level responses have largely only been identified in a single species in response to a single stress and their level of conservation is unknown. We conclude that there is a need for further research regarding the molecular mechanisms of plant developmental responses to climate change factors in general, and that this lack of data is particularly prevalent in the case of interactive effects of multiple climate change factors. As future growing conditions will likely expose plants to multiple climate change factors simultaneously, with a sum negative influence on global agriculture, further research in this area is critical.

TI Plant adaptation or acclimation to rising CO2? Insight from first
   multigenerational RNA-Seq transcriptome
SO GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) directly determines the rate of plant photosynthesis and indirectly effects plant productivity and fitness and may therefore act as a selective pressure driving evolution, but evidence to support this contention is sparse. Using Plantago lanceolata L. seed collected from a naturally high CO2 spring and adjacent ambient CO2 control site, we investigated multigenerational response to future, elevated atmospheric CO2. Plants were grown in either ambient or elevated CO2 (700 mu mol mol(-1)), enabling for the first time, characterization of the functional and population genomics of plant acclimation and adaptation to elevated CO2. This revealed that spring and control plants differed significantly in phenotypic plasticity for traits underpinning fitness including above-ground biomass, leaf size, epidermal cell size and number and stomatal density and index. Gene expression responses to elevated CO2 (acclimation) were modest [33-131 genes differentially expressed (DE)], whilst those between control and spring plants (adaptation) were considerably larger (689-853 DE genes). In contrast, population genomic analysis showed that genetic differentiation between spring and control plants was close to zero, with no fixed differences, suggesting that plants are adapted to their native CO2 environment at the level of gene expression. An unusual phenotype of increased stomatal index in spring but not control plants in elevated CO2 correlated with altered expression of stomatal patterning genes between spring and control plants for three loci (YODA, CDKB1; 1 and SCRM2) and between ambient and elevated CO2 for four loci (ER, YODA, MYB88 and BCA1). We propose that the two positive regulators of stomatal number (SCRM2) and CDKB1; 1 when upregulated act as key controllers of stomatal adaptation to elevated CO2. Combined with significant transcriptome reprogramming of photosynthetic and dark respiration and enhanced growth in spring plants, we have identified the potential basis of plant adaptation to high CO2 likely to occur over coming decades.

TI Two FERONIA-like receptor (FLR) genes are required to maintain
   architecture, fertility, and seed yield in rice
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB The Arabidopsis gene FERONIA (FER) regulates cell elongation and fertility. Although the function of FER in promoting plant growth and regulating fructification in dicotyledon Arabidopsis has been investigated, how homologous FERONIA-like receptors (FLRs) function in the monocotyledon rice crop is little known. In this study, we generated flr1 and flr2 T-DNA insertion null mutants and investigated potential role of FLRs in rice yield. We observed that both FLR1 and FLR2 were involved in tillering of rice, but at different levels. Interestingly, FLR1 and FLR2 showed different functions related to fertility, and FLR1 might be specifically involved in rice male gametophyte development. With these similar but different functions, we suggest that FLR1 and FLR2 might function in complementary ways to regulate the yield of rice. The similar and different functions of FLR1 and FLR2 also suggest that there might be differentiation from FER to the duplication of FLRs, with FLR1 and FLR2 taking on partial functions from FER.

TI Characterization of Tamyb10 allelic variants and development of STS
   marker for pre-harvest sprouting resistance in Chinese bread wheat
SO MOLECULAR BREEDING
AB Wheat grain color does not only affect the brightness of flour but also seed dormancy and pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance. The transcription factor Tamyb10 is an important candidate for R-1 gene, and the expression of its homologs determines wheat seed coat color. In the present study, the allelic variations of Tamyb10 were explored in a set of Chinese bread wheat varieties and advanced lines with different PHS tolerance, and a sequenced-tagged site (STS) marker for Tamyb10-D1 gene was developed, designated as Tamyb10D, which could be used as an efficient and reliable marker to evaluate the depth dormancy of wheat seeds. Using the marker Tamyb10D, 1629- and 1178-bp PCR fragments were amplified from the tolerant varieties, whereas a 1178-bp fragment was from the susceptible ones. Of the Chinese bread wheat varieties and advanced lines, 103 were used to validate the relationship between the polymorphic fragments of Tamyb10D and PHS tolerance. Statistical analysis indicated that Tamyb10D was significantly (P < 0.001) associatedwith depth of seed dormancy in these germplasms. To further confirm the association between allelic variants of Tamyb10-D1 and PHS tolerance, 200 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between Zhongyou 9507 (1178-bp fragment) and Yangxiaomai (1178- and 1629-bp fragments) were genotyped using the marker Tamyb10D. General linear model analysis indicated that variation in Tamyb10-D1 had a significant (P < 0.001) association with the germination index (GI) values, explaining 13.7, 4.7, and 9.8 % of the phenotypic variation in GI in Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and the averaged data from those environments, respectively. In addition, among the 103 wheat varieties, 8 Tamyb10 genotypes (Tamybl0-A1, Tamybl0-B1, and Tamyb10-D1 loci) were detected, namely, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab, bba, and bbb, and these were significantly associated with GI value.

TI Lipidomic profiling analysis reveals the dynamics of phospholipid
   molecules in Arabidopsis thaliana seedling growth
SO JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY
AB High-throughput lipidomic profiling provides a sensitive approach for discovering minor lipid species. By using an advance in electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, a large set of phospholipid molecular species (126 species) with high resolution were identified from Arabidopsis seedling; of them 31 species are newly identified (16 are unique in plants), including 13 species of phosphatidic acid (PA), nine phosphatidylcholine, six phosphatidylinositol and three phosphatidylserine. Further analysis of the lipidomic profile reveals dynamics of phospholipids and distinct species alterations during seedling development. PA molecules are found at the lowest levels in imbibition and follow an increasing trend during seedling growth, while phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) molecules show the opposite pattern with highest levels at imbibition and a general decreasing trend at later stages. Of PA molecular species, 34:2-, 34:3-, 36:4-, 36:5-, 38:3- and 38:4-PA increase during radicle emergence, and 34:2- and 34:3-PA reach highest levels during hypocotyl and cotyledon emergence from the seed coat. Conversely, molecular species of PE show higher levels in imbibition and decrease in later stages. These results suggest the crucial roles of specific molecular species and homeostasis of phospholipid molecules in seedling growth and provide insights into the mechanisms of how phospholipid molecules are involved in regulating plant development.

TI Overexpression of a garlic nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) B gene, AsNF-YB3,
   affects seed germination and plant growth in transgenic tobacco
SO PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE
AB Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) is a ubiquitous transcription factor found in many eukaryotic organisms. NF-Y consists of three distinct subunits, namely, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC. In this study, a NF-YB gene, AsNF-YB3, containing the full-length coding region was isolated from garlic. A sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that AsNF-YB3 clustered with TaNF-YB2 and AtNF-YB3. AsNF-YB3 was expressed in various organs, including the roots, cloves and leaves. A real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that GA(3), ABA and MeJA treatment upregulated the expression of AsNF-YB3 transcript. Overexpressing AsNF-YB3 in tobacco plants significantly accelerated germination compared to the wild type. Moreover, the total soluble sugar, fructose and sucrose levels were significantly higher in transgenic tobacco lines that constitutively overexpressed AsNF-YB3, suggesting that AsNF-YB3 might be involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Transgenic tobacco plants that overexpressed AsNF-YB3 displayed enhanced root elongation and shoot growth. The overexpression of AsNF-YB3 also strongly promoted early flowering in tobacco. The results of this study in tobacco suggest that garlic AsNF-YB3 likely plays an important role as a plant growth regulator.

TI Nutritional functions of the funiculus in Brassica napus seed maturation
   revealed by transcriptome and dynamic metabolite profile analyses
SO PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
AB The funiculus provides the sole channel of communication between the seed and the parent plant; however, little is known about its role in nutrient supply during seed maturation. Here, we investigated the dynamic metabolite profiles of the funiculus during seed maturation in Brassica napus. The funiculus was fully developed at 21 days after flowering (DAF), but the levels of nutrients, including carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, increased rapidly from 21 to 35 DAF. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis and correlation analysis identified 37 metabolites that correlated closely with seed fresh weight. To determine the influence of silique wall photosynthesis on the metabolites in the funiculus, we also covered the siliques of intact plants with aluminum foil; in these plants, the funiculus and silique wall had lower metabolite levels, compared with control. RNA-sequencing analysis of the funiculi in the dark-treated and light-exposed siliques showed that the expression of genes encoding nutrient transporters significantly increased in the funiculi in the dark-treated siliques. Furthermore, the transcripts encoding primary metabolic enzymes for amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and triacylglycerol assembly, and sucrose-starch metabolism, were also markedly up-regulated, despite the decline in metabolite levels of funiculi in the dark-treated silique. These results provide new insights into funiculus function in seed growth and synthesis of storage reserves in seeds, at the metabolic and transcriptional levels. The identification of these metabolites and genes also provides useful information for creating genetically enhanced oilseed crops with improved seed properties.

TI Transgenic soybean overexpressing GmSAMT1 exhibits resistance to
   multiple-HG types of soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines
SO PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) salicylic acid methyl transferase (GmSAMT1) catalyses the conversion of salicylic acid to methyl salicylate. Prior results showed that when GmSAMT1 was overexpressed in transgenic soybean hairy roots, resistance is conferred against soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines Ichinohe. In this study, we produced transgenic soybean overexpressing GmSAMT1 and characterized their response to various SCN races. Transgenic plants conferred a significant reduction in the development of SCN HG type 1.2.5.7 (race 2), HG type 0 (race 3) and HG type 2.5.7 (race 5). Among transgenic lines, GmSAMT1 expression in roots was positively associated with SCN resistance. In some transgenic lines, there was a significant decrease in salicylic acid titer relative to control plants. No significant seed yield differences were observed between transgenics and control soybean plants grown in one greenhouse with 22 degrees C day/night temperature, whereas transgenic soybean had higher yield than controls grown a warmer greenhouse (27 degrees C day/23 degrees C night) temperature. In a 1-year field experiment in Knoxville, TN, there was no significant difference in seed yield between the transgenic and nontransgenic soybean under conditions with negligible SCN infection. We hypothesize that GmSAMT1 expression affects salicylic acid biosynthesis, which, in turn, attenuates SCN development, without negative consequences to soybean yield or other morphological traits. Thus, we conclude that GmSAMT1 overexpression confers broad resistance to multiple SCN races, which would be potentially applicable to commercial production.

TI MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 function redundantly in seed storage protein
   accumulation in Arabidopsis
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (TFs), namely MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4, interact with Jasmonate Zim-domain proteins and are their direct targets. These TFs have been shown to function synergistically to control Arabidopsis growth and development. Our results showed similar MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 expression patterns during Arabidopsis seed development, which remained relatively high during seed mid-maturation. MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 acted redundantly in seed size, weight control, and in regulating seed storage protein accumulation. Triple mutants produced the largest seeds and single and double mutants' seeds were much larger than those of wild type. The weight of triple mutants' seeds was significantly higher than that of wild-type seeds, which was accompanied by an increase in seed storage protein contents. Triple mutants' seeds presented a marked decrease in 2S amounts relative to those in wild-type seeds. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectra sequencing results indicated that both the relative abundance and the peptide number of CRA1 and CRU3 were greatly increased in triple mutants compared to wild type. The expression of 2S1-2S5 decreased and that of CRA1 and CRU3 increased in triple mutants relative to those in wild types during seed development, which might have contributed to the low 2S and high 12S contents in triple mutants. Our results contribute to understanding the function of MYC2, MYC3, and MYC4 on seed development, and provide promising targets for genetic manipulations of protein-producing crops to improve the quantity and quality of seed storage proteins.

TI Molecular cloning and functional characterization of DkMATE1 involved in
   proanthocyanidin precursor transport in persimmon (Diospyros kaki
   Thunb.) fruit
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Persimmon fruits accumulate a large amount of proanthocyanidins (PAs) in "tannin cells" during development that cause the sensation of astringency due to coagulation of oral proteins. Pollination constant non-astringent (PCNA) is a spontaneous mutant persimmon phenotype that loses its astringency naturally on the tree at maturity; while the more common non-PCNA fruits remain rich in PAs until they are fully ripened. Here, we isolated a DkMATE1 gene encoding a Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) family protein from the Chinese PCNA (C-PCNA) 'Eshi 1'. Expression patterns of DkMATE1 were positively correlated with the accumulation of PAs in different types of persimmons fruits during fruit development. An analysis of the inferred amino acid sequences and phylogenetic relationships indicated that DkMATE1 is a putative PA precursor transporter, and subcellular localization assays revealed that DkMATE1 is localized in the vacuolar membrane. Ectopic expression of the DkMATE1 in Arabidopsis tt12 mutant supported that DkMATE1 could complement its biological function in transporting epicatechin 3'-O-glucoside as a PAs precursor from the cytoplasm to vacuole. Furthermore, the transient over-expression and silencing of DkMATE1 in 'Mopanshi' persimmon leaves resulted in a significant increase and a decrease in PA content, respectively. The analysis of cis-elements in DkMATE1 promoter regions indicated that DkMATE1 might be regulated by DkMYB4, another well-known structural gene in persimmon. Overall, our results show that DkMATE1 may be an essential PA precursor membrane transporter that plays an important role in PA biosynthesis in persimmon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI Genome-wide analysis of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA)
   gene family and functional characterization of FBA7 in tomato
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme in plants that is involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the Calvin cycle. FBA genes play significant roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses and also regulate growth and development. Despite the importance of FBA genes, little is known about it in tomato. In this study, we identified 8 FBA genes in tomato and classified them into 2 subgroups based on a phylogenetic tree, gene structures, and conserved motifs. Five (SlFBA1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and three (SlFBA6, 7, and 8) SlFBA proteins were predicted to be localized in chloroplasts and cytoplasm, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of FBAs from tomato, Arabidopsis, rice, and other organisms suggested that SlFBA shared the highest protein homology with FBAs from other plants. Synteny analysis indicated that segmental duplication events contributed to the expansion of the tomato FBA family. The expression profiles revealed that all SlFBAs were involved in the response to low and high temperature stresses. SlFBA7 overexpression increased the expression and activities of other main enzymes in Calvin cycle, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), seed size and stem diameter. SlFBA7 overexpression enhanced tolerances in seed germination under suboptimal temperature stresses. Taken together, comprehensive analyses of SlFBAs would provide a basis for understanding of evolution and function of SlFBA family. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI CsWRKY46, a WRKY transcription factor from cucumber, confers cold
   resistance in transgenic-plant by regulating a set of cold-stress
   responsive genes in an ABA-dependent manner
SO PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Plant WRKY transcription factors are trans-regulatory proteins that are involved in plant immune responses, development and senescence; however, their roles in abiotic stress are still not well understood, especially in the horticultural crop cucumber. In this study, a novel cucumber WRKY gene, CsWRKY46 was cloned and identified, which was up-regulated in response to cold stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. CsWRKY46 is belonging to group II of the WRKY family, CsWRKY46 was found exclusively in the nucleus, as indicated by a transient expression assay. Yeast one-hybrid assay shown that CsWRKY46 interact with the W-box in the promoter of ABI5. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines over expressing CsWRKY46, WRK46-OE1 and WRK46-OE5 had higher seedling survival rates upon freezing treatment compared with that of the wild-type. The above over-expression lines also showed much a higher proline accumulation, less electrolyte leakage and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Furthermore, the CsWRKY46 overexpression lines were hypersensitive to ABA during seed germination, but the seedlings were not. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that the expression levels of the ABA responsive transcription factor ABI5 were higher in the WRKY46-OE lines than in wild-type and that the overexpression of CsWRKY46 increased the expression of stress-inducible genes, including RD29A and COR47. Taken together, our results demonstrated that CsWRKY46 from cucumber conferred cold tolerance to transgenic plants and positively regulated the cold signaling pathway in an ABA-dependent manner.

TI Increasing seed size and quality by manipulating BIG SEEDS1 in legume
   species
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Plant organs, such as seeds, are primary sources of food for both humans and animals. Seed size is one of the major agronomic traits that have been selected in crop plants during their domestication. Legume seeds are a major source of dietary proteins and oils. Here, we report a conserved role for the BIG SEEDS1 (BS1) gene in the control of seed size and weight in the model legume Medicago truncatula and the grain legume soybean (Glycine max). BS1 encodes a plant-specific transcription regulator and plays a key role in the control of the size of plant organs, including seeds, seed pods, and leaves, through a regulatory module that targets primary cell proliferation. Importantly, down-regulation of BS1 orthologs in soybean by an artificial microRNA significantly increased soybean seed size, weight, and amino acid content. Our results provide a strategy for the increase in yield and seed quality in legumes.

TI Genomic Imprinting in the Endosperm Is Systematically Perturbed in
   Abortive Hybrid Tomato Seeds
SO MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB Hybrid seed failure represents an important postzygotic barrier to interbreeding among species of wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon) and other flowering plants. We studied genome-wide changes associated with hybrid seed abortion in the closely related Solanum peruvianum and S. chilense where hybrid crosses yield high proportions of inviable seeds due to endospermfailure and arrested embryo development. Based on differences of seed size in reciprocal hybrid crosses and developmental evidence implicating endosperm failure, we hypothesized that perturbed genomic imprinting is involved in this strong postzygotic barrier. Consequently, we surveyed the transcriptomes of developing endosperms from intra-and inter-specific crosses using tissues isolated by laser-assisted microdissection. We implemented a novel approach to estimate parent-of-origin-specific expression using both homozygous and heterozygous nucleotide differences between parental individuals and identified candidate imprinted genes. Importantly, we uncovered systematic shifts of "normal" (intraspecific) maternal: paternal transcript proportions in hybrid endosperms; the average maternal proportion of gene expression increased in both crossing directions but was stronger with S. peruvianum in the maternal role. These genome-wide shifts almost entirely eliminated paternally expressed imprinted genes in S. peruvianum hybrid endosperm but also affected maternally expressed imprinted genes and all other assessed genes. These profound, systematic changes in parental expression proportions suggest that core processes of transcriptional regulation are functionally compromised in hybrid endosperm and contribute to hybrid seed failure.

TI A novel arrangement of zinc finger nuclease system for in vivo targeted
   genome engineering: the tomato LEC1-LIKE4 gene case
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB A selection-free, highly efficient targeted mutagenesis approach based on a novel ZFN monomer arrangement for genome engineering in tomato reveals plant trait modifications.
   How to achieve precise gene targeting in plants and especially in crops remains a long-sought goal for elucidating gene function and advancing molecular breeding. To address this issue, zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-based technology was developed for the Solanum lycopersicum seed system. A ZFN architecture design with an intronic sequence between the two DNA recognition sites was evaluated for its efficiency in targeted gene mutagenesis. Custom engineered ZFNs for the developmental regulator LEAFY-COTYLEDON1-LIKE4 (L1L4) coding for the beta subunit of nuclear factor Y, when transiently expressed in tomato seeds, cleaved the target site and stimulated imperfect repair driven by nonhomologous end-joining, thus, introducing mutations into the endogenous target site. The successful in planta application of the ZFN platform resulted in L1L4 mutations which conferred heterochronic phenotypes during development. Our results revealed that sequence changes upstream of the DNA binding domain of L1L4 can lead to phenotypic diversity including fruit organ. These results underscore the utility of engineered ZFN approach in targeted mutagenesis of tomato plant which may accelerate translational research and tomato breeding.

TI Upregulation of LINC-AP2 is negatively correlated with AP2 gene
   expression with Turnip crinkle virus infection in Arabidopsis thaliana
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB A long intergenic noncoding RNA LINC - AP2 is upregulated and negatively correlated with AP2 gene expression with Turnip crinkle virus infection in Arabidopsis.
   Plant vegetative growth and floral reproductive structure were severely retarded and distorted in Turnip crinkle virus (TCV)-infected Arabidopsis thaliana. Compared to mock-inoculated plants, the stamen filaments were shorter in flowers of TCV-infected plants. However, TCV-infected plants can still produce normal seeds through artificial pollination, indicating both its pollen and stigma were biologically functional. From our high-throughput RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis, a floral structure-related APETALA2 (AP2) gene was found to be downregulated and its neighboring long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNA), At4NC069370 (named LINC-AP2 in this study), were upregulated significantly in TCV-infected plants. This LINC-AP2 was further confirmed for its existence using 5'RACE technology. LINC-AP2 overexpression (LINC-AP2 OE) transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated to compare with TCV-infected WT plants. TCV-infected LINC-AP2 OE plants which contained lower AP2 gene expression displayed more severe symptoms (including floral structure distortion) and higher TCV-CP gene transcript and coat protein levels. Furthermore, compared to TCV-infected WT plants, TCV-infected ap2 mutant plants failed to open their flower buds and displayed more severe viral symptoms. In conclusion, upregulation of LINC-AP2 is negatively correlated with AP2 gene expression with TCV infection in Arabidopsis.

TI Identification of the invertase gene family (INVs) in tea plant and
   their expression analysis under abiotic stress
SO PLANT CELL REPORTS
AB Fourteen invertase genes were identified in the tea plant, all of which were shown to participate in regulating growth and development, as well as in responding to various abiotic stresses.
   Invertase (INV) can hydrolyze sucrose into glucose and fructose, which plays a principal role in regulating plant growth and development as well as the plants response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. However, currently, there is a lack of reported information, regarding the roles of INVs in either tea plant development or in the tea plants response to various stresses. In this study, 14 INV genes were identified from the transcriptome data of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), and named CsINV1-5 and CsINV7-15. Based on the results of a Blastx search and phylogenetic analysis, the CsINV genes could be clustered into 6 acid invertase (AI) genes and 8 alkaline/neutral invertase (A/N-Inv) genes. The results of tissue-specific expression analysis showed that the transcripts of all the identified CsINV genes are detectable in various tissues. Under various abiotic stress conditions, the expression patterns of the 14 CsINV genes were diverse in both the leaves and roots, and some of them were shown to be significantly expressed. Overall, we hypothesize that the identified CsINV genes all participate in regulating growth and development in the tea plant, and most likely through different signaling pathways that regulate the carbohydrate allocation and the ratio of hexose and sucrose for improving the resistance of the leaves and the roots of the tea plant to various abiotic stresses.

TI Short versus long term effects of cyanide on sugar metabolism and
   transport in dormant walnut kernels
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Tree seed dormancy release by cold stratification accompanies with the embryo increased gluconeogenesis competence. Cyanide also breaks seed dormancy however, integrated information about its effects on carbon metabolism is lacking. Accordingly, the impacts of HCN on germination, lipid gluconeogenesis and sugar transport capacity of walnut (Juglans regia L) kernels were investigated during 10-days period prior to radicle protrusion. HCN increased walnut kernel germination and within four days of kernel incubation, hastened the decline of starch, reducing and non-reducing sugars and led to greater activities of alkaline invertase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. From four days of kernel incubation onwards, starch and non-reducing sugars accumulated only in the HCN treated axes. Cyanide also increased the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glyoxysomal succinate oxidase and led to greater acid invertase activity during the aforementioned period. The expressions of both sucrose transporter (JrSUT1) and H+-ATPase (JrAHA1) genes especially in cotyledons and H+-ATPase activity in kernels were significantly enhanced by exposure to cyanide. Thus in short-term HCN led to prevalence of carbohydrate catabolic events such as oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and possibly glycolysis in dormant walnut kernels. Long-term effects however, are increased gluconeogenesis and enhanced sugar transport capacity of kernels as a prerequisite for germination. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Seed maturation: Simplification of control networks in plants
SO PLANT SCIENCE
AB Networks controlling developmental or metabolic processes in plants are often complex as a consequence of the duplication and specialisation of the regulatory genes as well as the numerous levels of transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls added during evolution. Networks serve to accommodate multicellular complexity and increase robustness to environmental changes. Mathematical simplification by regrouping genes or pathways in a limited number of hubs has facilitated the construction of models for complex traits. In a complementary approach, a biological simplification can be achieved by using genetic modification to understand the core and singular ancestral function of the network, which is likely to be more prevalent within the plant kingdom rather than specific to a species. With this viewpoint, we review examples of simplification successfully undertaken in yeast and other organisms. A strategy of progressive complementation of single, double and triple mutants of seed maturation confirmed the fundamental role of the AFL sub-family of B3 transcription factors as master regulators of seed maturation, illustrating that biological simplification of complex networks could be more widely applied in plants. Defining minimal control networks will facilitate evolutionary comparisons of regulatory processes and the identification of an essential gene set for synthetic biology. (C) 2016 The Authors.

It is partially determined by genetic factors, but is also dependent on the environmental conditions experienced by the mother plant during seed maturation, as well as those imposed during the post-harvest and storage periods. For practical reasons, the variation in longevity has repeatedly been analysed by treating fresh seed to various induced ageing protocols, but the extent to which these procedures mimic the natural ageing process remains debatable. Here, a comparison was attempted between the wheat genomic regions identified by biparental mapping as harbouring determinants of viability loss identified in grain which had been either aged artificially or had been stored long term. Only one locus proved to be shared, but even here, the parental origin of the positive allele differed. Correlation analysis revealed no relationship between various induced ageing treatments and long-term storage.

TI Revisiting the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) gene
   family reveals cryptic FLOWERING LOCUS T gene homologs in gymnosperms
   and sheds new light on functional evolution
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Angiosperms and gymnosperms are two major groups of extant seed plants. It has been suggested that gymnosperms lack FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a key integrator at the core of flowering pathways in angiosperms. Taking advantage of newly released gymnosperm genomes, we revisited the evolutionary history of the plant phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) gene family through phylogenetic reconstruction. Expression patterns in three gymnosperm taxa and heterologous expression in Arabidopsis were studied to investigate the functions of gymnosperm FT-like and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1)-like genes. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that an ancient gene duplication predating the divergence of seed plants gave rise to the FT and TFL1 genes. Expression patterns indicate that gymnosperm TFL1-like genes play a role in the reproductive development process, while GymFT1 and GymFT2, the FT-like genes resulting from a duplication event in the common ancestor of gymnosperms, function in both growth rhythm and sexual development pathways. When expressed in Arabidopsis, both spruce FT-like and TFL1-like genes repressed flowering. Our study demonstrates that gymnosperms do have FT-like and TFL1-like genes. Frequent gene and genome duplications contributed significantly to the expansion of the plant PEBP gene family. The expression patterns of gymnosperm PEBP genes provide novel insight into the functional evolution of this gene family.

TI Challenging the paradigms of leaf evolution: Class III HD-Zips in ferns
   and lycophytes
SO NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB Despite the extraordinary significance leaves have for life on Earth, their origin and development remain vigorously debated. More than a century of paleobotanical, morphological, and phylogenetic research has still not resolved fundamental questions about leaves. Developmental genetic data are sparse in ferns, and comparative studies of lycophytes and seed plants have reached opposing conclusions on the conservation of a leaf developmental program. We performed phylogenetic and expression analyses of a leaf developmental regulator (Class III HD-Zip genes; C3HDZs) spanning lycophytes and ferns. We show that a duplication and neofunctionalization of C3HDZs probably occurred in the ancestor of euphyllophytes, and that there is a common leaf developmental mechanism conserved between ferns and seed plants. We show C3HDZ expression in lycophyte and fern sporangia and show that C3HDZs have conserved expression patterns during initiation of lateral primordia (leaves or sporangia). This expression is maintained throughout sporangium development in lycophytes and ferns and indicates an ancestral role of C3HDZs in sporangium development. We hypothesize that there is a deep homology of all leaves and that a sporangium-specific developmental program was coopted independently for the development of lycophyte and euphyllophyte leaves. This provides molecular genetic support for a paradigm shift in theories of lycophyte leaf evolution.

TI VqDUF642, a gene isolated from the Chinese grape Vitis quinquangularis,
   is involved in berry development and pathogen resistance
SO PLANTA
AB Main conclusion The DUF642 gene VqDUF642 , isolated from the Chinese grape species V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, participates in berry development and defense responses against Erysiphe necator and Botrytis cinerea.
   The proteins with domains of unknown function 642 (DUF642) comprise a large protein family according to cell wall proteomic analyses in plants. However, the works about functional characterization of DUF642s in plant development and resistance to pathogens are scarce. In this study, a gene encoding a DUF642 protein was isolated from Chinese grape V. quinquangularis accession Danfeng-2, and designated as VqDUF642. Its full-length cDNA contains a 1107-bp open reading frame corresponding to a deduced 368-amino acid protein. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis showed that VqDUF642 is highly homologous to one of the DUF642 proteins (VvDUF642) in V. vinifera. The VqDUF642 was localized to the cell wall of tobacco epidermal cells. Accumulation of VqDUF642 protein and VqDUF642 transcript abundance increased at the later stage of grape berry development in Danfeng-2. Overexpression of VqDUF642 in transgenic tomato plants accelerated plant growth and reduced susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. Transgenic Thompson Seedless grapevine plants overexpressing VqDUF642 exhibited enhanced resistance to Erysiphe necator and B. cinerea. Moreover, VqDUF642 overexpression affected the expression of a couple of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes in transgenic tomato and grapevine upon pathogen inoculation. Taken together, these results suggest that VqDUF642 is involved in plant development and defense against pathogenic infections.

TI Comparative analysis of nine different small heat shock protein gene
   promoters in Oryza sativa L. subsp indica
SO PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION
AB Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), the intra cellular chaperons respond to high temperatures and other stresses, are expressed under the control of the heat shock factors, which recognize highly conserved cis-regulatory elements (CREs). The present study was designed to identify and compare nine different sHSP gene promoters from rice on the basis of their location on chromosomes, sequence similarities, evolutionary relationship and putative binding sites of transcription factors. Additionally, they were analyzed for their functional importance in the regulation of sHSP genes. For this, 5' upstream region of nine sHSP genes from Oryza sativa was amplified, sequenced and analyzed. RFLP mapping approach using molecular linkage maps of three-way cross-population showed that OsHSP 16.9A, OsHSP 16.9B, OsHSP 16.9C and OsHSP C-II genes were clustered on the short arm of chromosome 1 with a 1238-bp overlapped sequence between OsHSP 16.9A and OsHSP 16.9B, whereas OsHSP 17.3, OsHSP 17.7, OsHSP 17.9, OsHSP 18.0 and OsHSP 26 genes were clustered on chromosome 3 with a 420-bp overlapped sequence between OsHSP 17.3 and OsHSP 18.0. Evolutionary analysis revealed that sHSPs that clustered on different chromosomes in the same specie showed high sequence similarity and evolved prior to the divergence of their localization. Eighteen CREs remained conserved among all sHSP gene promoters during evolution. These common regulatory elements are related to disease resistance, hormonal responses, light responses, seed storage proteins, tissue-specific expression, pollen development and other environmental stresses. Moreover, CCAATBOX1 was also found in all sHSP gene promoters involved in the regulation of heat shock response. Conclusively, promoter region of sHSP genes seems to be capable of driving genes expression during stress and genetic manipulation might be helpful in producing better quality rice.

TI Genome-wide investigation and expression analyses of the
   pentatricopeptide repeat protein gene family in foxtail millet
SO BMC GENOMICS
AB Background: Pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are encoded by a large gene family of approximately 450 members in Arabidopsis and 477 in rice, which characterized by tandem repetitions of a degenerate 35 amino acid characteristic sequence motifs. A large majority of the PPR genes in the higher plants are localized in organelles. Their functions remain as yet largely unknown. The majority of characterized PPR proteins have been found to function in modulating the expression plastid and mitochondrial genes in plants.
   Results: Here, a genome-wide identification and comparison of the PPR genes from 5 organisms was performed, including the moss Physcomitrella patens, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii, the eudicot Arabidopsis, and the monocots rice and foxtail millet. It appears that the expansion of this gene family prior to the divergence of the euphyllophytes and the lycophytes in land plants. The duplication and divergence rates of the foxtail millet PPR genes (SiPPRs) showed that the expansion period of this gene family around 400 Mya, and indicated that genome segmental duplication was very likely the primary mechanism underlying the expansion of the PPR gene family in vascular plants. An analysis of a complete set of SiPPR genes/proteins that included classification, chromosomal location, orthologous relationships, duplication analysis, and auxiliary motifs is presented. Expression analysis of the SiPPR genes under stress conditions revealed that the expression of 24 SiPPR genes was responsive to abiotic stress. Subcellular localization analysis of 11 PPR proteins indicated that 5 proteins were localized to chloroplasts, that 4 were localized to mitochondria, and that 2 were localized to the cytoplasm.
   Conclusions: Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding the roles of PPR proteins and will be useful in the prioritization of particular PPR proteins for subsequent functional validation studies in foxtail millet.

TI Proteomic Dissection of Seed Germination and Seedling Establishment in
   Brassica napus
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The success of seed germination and establishment of a normal seedling are key determinants of plant species propagation. At present, only a few studies have focused on the genetic control of seed germination by using a proteomic approach in Brassica napus. In the present study, the protein expression pattern of seed germination was investigated using differential fluorescence two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in B. napus. One hundred and thirteen differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) that were mainly involved in storage (23.4%), energy metabolism (18.9%), protein metabolism (16.2%), defense/disease (12.6%), seed maturation (11.7%). carbohydrate metabolism (4.5%), lipid metabolism (4.5%), amino acids metabolism (3.6%), cell growth/division (3.6%), and some unclear functions (2.7%) were observed by proteomic analysis. Seventeen genes corresponding to 11 DEPs were identified within or near the associated linkage disequilibrium regions related to seed germination and vigor quantitative traits reported in B. napus in previous studies. The expression pattern of proteins showed that heterotrophic metabolism could be activated in the process of seed germination and that the onset of defense mechanisms might start during seed germination. These findings will help generate a more in-depth understanding of the mobilization of seed storage reserves and regulation mechanisms of the germination process in B. napus.

TI Activation of HLS1 by Mechanical Stress via Ethylene-Stabilized EIN3 Is
   Crucial for Seedling Soil Emergence
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB The seeds of terrestrial flowering plants often start their life cycle in subterranean darkness. To protect the fragile apical meristematic tissues and cotyledons from mechanical injuries during soil penetration, dicotyledonous seedlings form an elegant apical hook at the top of the hypocotyl. The apical hook has been considered as an adaption structure to the subterranean environment. However, the role of the apical hook in seedling emergence and the molecular mechanism of apical hook formation under real-life conditions remain highly speculative. Here, we find that HOOKLESS 1 (HLS1), a critical gene in apical hook formation in Arabidopsis thaliana, is required for seedling emergence from the soil. When grown under soil, hls1 mutant exhibits severe emergence defects. By contrast, HLS1 overexpression in the hls1 background fully restores emergence defects and displays better emergence capacity than that of WT. Our results indicate that HLS1 transcription is stimulated in response to the mechanical stress of soil cover, which is dependent on the function of the transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) and EIN3-LIKE 1 (EIL1). Soil-conferred mechanical stress activates the ethylene signaling pathway to stabilize EIN3 by repressing the activity of the F-box proteins EBF1 and EBF2. These combined results reveal a signaling pathway in which plant seedlings transduce the mechanical pressure of soil cover to correctly modulate apical hook formation during soil emergence.

TI Identification of microRNAs Actively Involved in Fatty Acid Biosynthesis
   in Developing Brassica napus Seeds Using High-Throughput Sequencing
SO FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB Seed development has a critical role during the spermatophyte life cycle. In Brassica napus, a major oil crop, fatty acids are synthesized and stored in specific tissues during embryogenesis, and understanding the molecular mechanism underlying fatty acid biosynthesis during seed development is an important research goal. In this study, we constructed three small RNA libraries from early seeds at 14, 21, and 28 days after flowering (DAF) and used high-throughput sequencing to examine microRNA (miRNA) expression. A total of 85 known miRNAs from 30 families and 1160 novel miRNAs were identified, of which 24, including 5 known and 19 novel miRNAs, were found to be involved in fatty acid biosynthesis.bna-miR156b, bna-miR156c, bna-miR156g, novel_mir_1706, novel_mir_1407, novel_mir_173, and novel_mir_104 were significantly down-regulated at 21 DAF and 28 DAF, whereas bna-miR159, novel_mir_1081, novel_mir_19 and novel_mir_555 were significantly up-regulated. In addition, we found that some miRNAs regulate functional genes that are directly involved in fatty acid biosynthesis and that other miRNAs regulate the process of fatty acid biosynthesis by acting on a large number of transcription factors. The miRNAs and their corresponding predicted targets were partially validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Our data suggest that diverse and complex miRNAs are involved in the seed development process and that miRNAs play important roles in fatty acid biosynthesis during seed development.
