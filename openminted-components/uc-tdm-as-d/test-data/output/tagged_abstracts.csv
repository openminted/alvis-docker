The goals of this study were to develop numerous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> region and identify diagnostic gene-specific SNP marker assays for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Forty-three SNP markers were developed and mapped on chromosome 2BS tightly linked with the resistance gene <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> across four mapping populations representing a total of 1528 gametes. Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays were designed for all identified SNPs. <span class='openminted_phenotype'>Resistance</span> gene analogs (RGAs) linked with the <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> locus were identified and RGA-based SNP markers were developed. The diagnostic potential of the SNPs co-segregating with <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> was evaluated in a diverse set of 133 cultivars and breeding lines. Six SNP markers were consistent with the <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> phenotype and are accurately predictive of <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> for all <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span> lines/cultivars in the panel. <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> was mapped relative to SNP markers in four populations. Six SNP markers exhibited high quality clustering in the KASP assay and are suitable for MAS of <span class='openminted_gene'>Lr16</span> in <span class='openminted_taxon'>wheat</span> breeding programs.
