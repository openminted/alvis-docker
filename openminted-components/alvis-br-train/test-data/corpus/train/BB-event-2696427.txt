Presence of the fish pathogen Vibrio salmonicida in fish farm sediments.
The persistence of the fish pathogen Vibrio salmonicida in fish farm sediments was studied by use of fluorescent-antibody techniques. The specificities of the monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal rabbit serum used in the study were tested against a number of Vibrio strains, including 4 isolates from intestinal tracts of healthy fish and 98 isolates from sediments. V. salmonicida was detected in sediment samples from diseased farms several months after an outbreak of the disease. The bacterium was also detected in a sediment sample from a disease-free fish farm. No V. salmonicida could be detected in sediments not influenced by fish farming. The number of positive samples was generally higher with application of rabbit serum as opposed to use of monoclonal antibodies, indicating that the rabbit serum may cross-react with other bacteria.
