Isolation of Helicobacter pullorum from patients with enteritis.
Helicobacter pullorum, recently described as sp. nov., is commonly isolated from asymptomatic poultry. Two cases of human enteritis associated with H. pullorum, one of them in an immunocompromised patient, are reported. Problems in the correct species identification by means of phenotypic and genotypic methods are discussed and for the first time a fatty acid pattern of Helicobacter pullorum is presented.
