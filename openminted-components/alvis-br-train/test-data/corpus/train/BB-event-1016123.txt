An evaluation of selective broths based on the bi-selenite ion and on hypertonic strontium chloride in Salmonellae detection in egg products.
Of the 104 isolations of Salmonella sp. from egg pulp, 97 were obtained from strontium chloride M broth, 42 from strontium selenite broth and 57 from strontium selenite A broth. The results suggest that the first medium may be used more successfully than bi-selenite based media for enrichment and subsequent detection of salmonellae in egg products; however, the growth of S. pullorum was not satisfactory in strontium chloride M broth.
