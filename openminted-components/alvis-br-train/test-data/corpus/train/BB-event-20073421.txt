The effect of interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide on the growth of Francisella tularensis LVS in murine macrophage-like cell line J774.
Francisella tularensis, a causative agent of human tularemia, displaying the ability to proliferate inside the human cells.
To evaluate the growth potential of F. tularensis LVS strain in macrophage-like cell line J774 modulated by recombinant interferon gamma and E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide.
Stimulation of J774 cells either by interferon-gamma or lipopolysaccharide alone, or especially in combination before infection F. tularensis, revealed protective effects. Higher concentrations of stimulating agents were needed to inhibit ongoing F. tularensis infection.
Stimulation of J774 cell line by combination of interferon-gamma with lipopolysaccharide inhibits the intracellular growth of F. tularensis.
