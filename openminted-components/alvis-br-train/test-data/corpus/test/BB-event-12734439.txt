Molecular diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria.
Diagnosis of infection due to nontuberculous mycobacteria is not easy, as it must be distinguished from colonization or contamination by other nontuberculous mycobacteria. Molecular methods offer many advantages over conventional methods of identification. The results are obtained rapidly, are reliable and reproducible, and even mixed or contaminated cultures can be examined. This review highlights the recent advances in molecular techniques for identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria.
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous towards the environment and have the potential to colonize and cause serious infection. An increasing number of species and clinical presentations are being described, and progress has been made towards the understanding of the underlying predisposing factors. Disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria is often associated with various forms of immunosuppression, particularly HIV infection, whereas mild forms of immune defects have been observed in some patients who, apart from their nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, seem to be healthy on initial examination. Molecular techniques have shown their usefulness for the identification of most mycobacteria. Probes are widely used in clinical laboratories for the identification of the most common mycobacterial species. Because automated DNA sequencing and the programs for analysing sequence data have become technically simpler, polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing is now used in many mycobacterial reference laboratories as a routine method for species identification.
Significant advances have been made with molecular tools for diagnosis of mycobacteria. The DNA microarray technique holds great promise for the future because it is easy to perform, it can be readily automated, and it allows the identification of a large number of mycobacterial species in one reaction.
