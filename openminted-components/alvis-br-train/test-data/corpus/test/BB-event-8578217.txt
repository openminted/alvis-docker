Sucralfate in Helicobacter pylori eradication strategies.
Sucralfate monotherapy has been shown to suppress but not eradicate Helicobacter pylori. The combination of sucralfate with antibiotic(s) has been evaluated recently in the treatment of H. pylori-positive duodenal ulcer. The aim of this article is to review the efficacy of sucralfate-containing duotherapy and triple therapy in duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates.
Reports on duotherapy and triple therapy including sucralfate as the mediating agent were analysed to assess the duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates.
One study on duotherapy with sucralfate and amoxycillin achieved an ulcer healing rate of 86% and H. pylori eradication rate of 40%, which compared favourably with sucralfate monotherapy that resulted in duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates of 65% and 0% respectively. A total of six studies have examined triple therapy using sucralfate with two antibiotics. The duodenal ulcer healing rates were generally over 90% and the H. pylori eradication rates about 80% (range 59% to 100%). In one comparative study, the 4-week duodenal ulcer healing and H. pylori eradication rates of sucralfate-containing triple therapy were not distinguishable from those of omeprazole-containing triple therapy.
It is concluded that sucralfate is an effective mediating agent for the eradication of H. pylori in patients with duodenal ulcer.
