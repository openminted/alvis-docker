Outcomes of emergency colectomy for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis.
Clostridium difficile has become increasingly a common cause of nosocomial infection with increasing antibiotic usage. Recently there has been an increase in the incidence of patients undergoing colectomy for fulminant C. difficile colitis (FCDC). Early surgical consultation is necessary to avoid delay in diagnosis. We present a retrospective review of the outcomes of colectomies for FCDC at our large district general hospital.
Over a twenty one month period, from January 2007 to September 2009, a total number of 20 patients underwent exploratory laparotomy for FCDC. A retrospective analysis of patients' case notes, was carried out retrieving all relevant. Data on haematology, biochemistry and imaging were extracted from the trust's on-line clinical databases.
A total number of 528 diagnosed cases with C. difficile infection were identified. Of these, twenty patients underwent colectomy for FCDC (3.7%). All patients had received antibiotics prior to symptoms development. 45% of patients had multiple antibiotics. 35% of patients developed FCDC after having three doses of prophylactic antibiotic (Cefuroxime) for a surgical procedure. Time from referral to having surgery varied. Seventeen patients received subtotal colectomy and end ileostomy in a single operation. Mortality rate was 40%.
Emergency colectomy for FCDC is associated with high mortality rate. The majority of patients who have significant co-morbidities (75%) did not survive following emergency colectomy. Therefore, it is crucial to identify those patients early in their disease course before they progress into FCDC and organ failure.
