Wolinella recta in adult gingivitis and periodontitis.
Wolinella recta has been associated with adult periodontitis, but its role in the disease remains uncertain. This report clarifies the distribution of W. recta in periodontally healthy and diseased subjects, and treated patients with recurrent disease. A specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum against W. recta strain 372 was used for indirect immunofluorescence localization of W. recta in dental plaque from untreated and treated patients. Supragingival plaque was collected from 15 periodontally healthy individuals (H), 10 adults with mild gingivitis (G1), 8 with severe gingivitis (G2) and 15 with periodontitis (AP). Subgingival samples from 23 diseased sites (G2 and AP) were examined as well. There was a significant difference (p = 0.000) between the proportions of W. recta in subgingival (4.4%) vs. supragingival (0.3%) plaque samples from AP. A significant difference (p = 0.000) in W. recta proportions was also detected between subgingival plaque samples of AP (4.4%) vs. G2 (1.2%). No significant difference in the mean % of W. recta was found between supragingival plaque of AP (0.3%) and G2 (0%), and samples of G1 (0.01%) and H (0.1%). In a separate study, 85 adults previously treated for moderate to severe adult periodontitis were monitored over a 12-month period for evidence of disease recurrence. Recurrent disease was detected at 32 sites in 18 subjects. Of these, 20 sites in 13 subjects were positive for W. recta. With subjects as the experimental unit, a significant increase in the proportions of W. recta was found at sites with recurrent disease (3.12%) as compared to stable, paired control sites (0.24%), but only when sites with breakdown and positive for W. recta were compared with their controls. These results indicate that W. recta is associated with some, but not all sites with advanced adult periodontitis. The association of W. recta with gingivitis was not statistically significant.
